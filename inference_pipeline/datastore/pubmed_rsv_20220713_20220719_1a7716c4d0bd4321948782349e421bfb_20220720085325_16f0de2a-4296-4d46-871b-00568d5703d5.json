Most studies applied traditional statistical methods and in some cases combined with a machine learning (ML) method. This is the first study to date to comparatively analyze five ML methods to select the one that most closely predicts mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. The aim of this single-center observational study is to classify, based on different types of variables, adult patients with COVID-19 at increased risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by a positive reverse transcriptase PCR. A total of 203 patients were admitted between March 15 and June 15, 2020 to a tertiary hospital. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Four supervised ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB) and support vector machine (SVM)) were compared with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) method proposed to have excellent scalability and high running speed, among other qualities. The results indicate that the XGB method has the best prediction accuracy (92%), high precision (>0.92) and high recall (>0.92). The KNN, SVM and DT approaches present moderate prediction accuracy (>80%), moderate recall (>0.80) and moderate precision (>0.80). The GNB algorithm shows relatively low classification performance. The variables with the greatest weight in predicting mortality were C reactive protein, procalcitonin, glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamyl pyruvic transaminase, neutrophils, D-dimer, creatinine, lactic acid, ferritin, days of non-invasive ventilation, septic shock and age. Based on these results, XGB is a solid candidate for correct classification of patients with COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) American Federation for Medical Research 2022. No commercial re-use.

Many patients will use the hospital non-electively or semielectively, and a large proportion are likely to be in the last years of life. We describe our multidisciplinary service to treatable but not curable cancer patients at University Hospitals Sussex. The team was a mixture of clinical nurse specialists and a clinical fellow supported by dedicated palliative medicine consultant time and oncology expertise. METHODS: We identified patients with cancer who had identifiable supportive care needs and record activity with clinical coding. We used a baseline 2019/2020 dataset of national (secondary uses service) data with discharge code 79 (patients who died during that year) to compare a dataset of patients seen by the service between September 2020 and September 2021 in order to compare outcomes. While this was during COVID-19 this was when the funding was available. RESULTS: We demonstrated a reduction in length of stay by an average of 1.43 days per admission and a reduction of 0.95 episodes of readmission rates. However, the costs of those admissions were found to be marginally higher. Even with the costs of the service, there is a clear return on investment with a benefit cost ratio of 1.4. CONCLUSIONS: A supportive oncology service alongside or allied to acute oncology but in conjunction with palliative care is feasible and cost-effective. This would support investment in such a service and should be nationally commissioned in conjunction with palliative care services seeing all conditions.", "CI": ["(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including patients with nosocomial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in four outbreak-affected wards, and all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive HCWs from a Swiss university-affiliated geriatric acute-care hospital that admitted both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients during the first pandemic wave in Spring 2020. We combined epidemiological and genetic sequencing data using a Bayesian modelling framework, and reconstructed transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 involving patients and HCWs, to determine who infected whom. We evaluated general transmission patterns according to case type (HCWs working in dedicated Covid-19 cohorting wards: HCWcovid; HCWs working in non-Covid-19 wards where outbreaks occurred: HCWoutbreak; patients with nosocomial Covid-19: patientnoso) by deriving the proportion of infections attributed to each case type across all posterior trees and comparing them to random expectations. Results: During the study period (March 1 to May 7, 2020) we included 180 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases: 127 HCWs (91 HCWcovid, 36 HCWoutbreak) and 53 patients. The attack rates ranged from 10-19% for patients, and 21% for HCWs. We estimated that 16 importation events occurred with high confidence (four patients, 12 HCWs) that jointly led to up to 41 secondary cases; in six additional cases (five HCWs, one patient), importation was possible with a posterior between 10-50%. Most patient-to-patient transmission events involved patients having shared a ward (95.2%, 95% credible interval [CrI] 84.2-100%), in contrast to those having shared a room (19.7%, 95%CrI 6.7-33.3%). Transmission events tended to cluster by case type: patientnoso were almost twice as likely to be infected by other patientnoso than expected (observed:expected ratio 2.16, 95%CrI 1.17 - 4.20, p = 0.006); similarly, HCWoutbreak were more than twice as likely to be infected by other HCWoutbreak than expected (2.72, 95%CrI 0.87-9.00, p = 0.06). The proportion of infectors being HCWcovid was as expected as random. We found a trend toward a greater proportion of high transmitters (>/=2 secondary cases) among HCWoutbreak than patientnoso in the late phases (28.6% vs. 11.8%) of the outbreak, although this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Most importation events were linked to HCW. Unexpectedly, transmission between HCWcovid was more limited than transmission between patients and HCWoutbreak. This finding highlights gaps in infection control and suggests possible areas of improvements to limit the extent of nosocomial transmission.

Nurses, in particular, have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors and struggled with intensive work, insufficiency of resources and uncertainty in the face of an unknown disease. Life satisfaction might protect nurses from the consequences of chronic stress. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of satisfaction with life in the relationship between depression, stress, anxiety and burnout (personal, work-related, and client-related). METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was performed, using an online questionnaire distributed via social networks. A total of 379 nurses completed the survey, comprising standardized measures of satisfaction with life, resilience (Resilience Scale), depression, anxiety, stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales), and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale). A hierarchical regression model was estimated for each burnout dimension. RESULTS: Participants showed high levels of work, personal and client-related burnout, 57.3%, 57%, and 35.1%, respectively. More than 70% of the respondents had a normal level of depressive symptoms, 66.8% presented normal level of anxiety and 33.5% of the respondents reported mild, moderate, severe or extremely severe symptoms of stress.

However, vaccine hesitancy has emerged as a major obstacle in several regions of the world, including Africa. The objective of this rapid review was to summarize the literature on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Africa. METHODS: We searched Scopus, Web of Science, African Index Medicus, and OVID Medline for studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 8, 2022, examining acceptance or hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine in Africa. Study characteristics and reasons for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were extracted from the included articles. RESULTS: A total of 71 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Majority (n = 25, 35%) of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia. Studies conducted in Botswana, Cameroun, Cote D'Ivoire, DR Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe were also included in the review. The vaccine acceptance rate ranged from 6.9 to 97.9%. The major reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns with vaccine safety and side effects, lack of trust for pharmaceutical industries and misinformation or conflicting information from the media. Factors associated with positive attitudes towards the vaccine included being male, having a higher level of education, and fear of contracting the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrated the contextualized and multifaceted reasons inhibiting or encouraging vaccine uptake in African countries. This evidence is key to operationalizing interventions based on facts as opposed to assumptions. Our paper provided important considerations for addressing the challenge of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and blunting the impact of the pandemic in Africa.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

This study aimed to investigate the level of nurses' fear in COVID-19 Central Hospitals in Iran. METHOD: The study is cross-sectional. The questionnaire was designed in two parts (demographic and the level of fear). The sampling method was quota and random. The questionnaires were completed by the same nurses after four weeks. RESULT: A total of 345 questionnaires were distributed (the response rate was 89.27%). 121 nurses (39.3%) were female. Most participants were in the 26-30 years group. paired t-test showed the mean fear of COVID-19 in the first and the fourth weeks was significant (P <0.001). There was a statistical relationship between demographic variables of gender, age, marriage, number of working shifts, having children, and work experience of nurses with the level of fear. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers have shown resilience and a spirit of professional sacrifice to overcome problems.

The study is the first to judge the now completed \"first wave\" of the vaccination efforts. The analysis is very relevant for the understanding why and where the vaccination process observed got stuck by the end of 2021. METHODS: Using data from 118 countries globally and weighted least squared and survival analysis, we identify a variety of factors playing crucial roles, including the availability of vaccines, pandemic pressures, economic strength measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), educational development, and political regimes. RESULTS: Examining the speed of vaccinations across countries until the Fall of 2021 when the global process got stuck, we find that initially authoritarian countries are slow in the vaccination process, while education is most relevant for scaling up the campaign, and the economic strength of the economies drives them to higher vaccination rates. In comparison to North and Middle America, European and Asian countries vaccinated initially fast for 5% and 10% vaccination rate thresholds, but became rather slow reaching the 30% vaccination level and above. The findings are robust to various applied estimation methods and model specifications. CONCLUSIONS: Democratic countries are much faster than authoritarian countries in their vaccination campaigns when controlling for other factors. This finding suggests that the quality of government and the political environment play a key role in popular support for government policies and programs. However, despite the early success of their vaccination campaigns, the democratic country group has been confronted with strong concerns of vaccine reluctance among their vast populations, indicating the two most potent variables explaining the speed of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are education and economic conditions.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many conferences have used all- or partially virtual formats. The conversion of the 2021 Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) conference, originally planned in-person for Houston, TX USA to an all-virtual format provided an opportunity to quantify the climate-related impacts of in-person versus virtual conferences. METHODS: From the 2021 CUGH conference registration data, we determined each registrant's distance from Houston. Using widely available, open-source formulas, we calculated the carbon footprint of each registrant's round-trip drive or flight had they traveled to Houston. We assumed that registrants traveling more than 300 miles would have flown, with the remainder traveling by automobile. RESULTS: Of 1909 registrants, 1447 would have traveled less than 4000 miles, and 389 would have traveled more than 10,000 miles round trip. Total travel-related carbon emissions were estimated at 2436 metric tons of CO2, equivalent to the conservation of 2994 acres of forest for a year. CONCLUSIONS: Organizations can now readily quantify the climate cost of annual conferences. CUGH's annual international conference, when held in-person, contributes significantly to carbon emissions. With its focus on promoting global health equity, CUGH may play a lead role in understanding the pros and cons for planetary health of in-person versus virtual conferences.

In this qualitative study, we used a nested process evaluation to aid interpretation of the trial and provide insight into factors influencing use of tests, understanding of test results, and how tests were used to inform behavioural decisions. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 60 participants (42 randomised to DCT and 18 randomised to self-isolation) who had been in close contact with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 carrier and had consented to take part in the trial. RESULTS: Data were organised into three overarching themes: (1) assessing the risks and benefits of DCT (2) use of testing during the study period and (3) future use of testing. Attitudes toward DCT as an alternative to self-isolation and behaviour during the testing period appeared to be informed by an assessment of the associated risks and benefits. Participants reported how important it was for them to avoid isolation, how necessary self-isolation was considered to be, and the ability of LFTs to detect infection. Behaviour during the testing period was modified to reduce risks and harms as much as possible. Testing was considered a potential compromise, reducing both risk of transmission and the negative impact of self-isolation, and was regarded as a way to return to normal. CONCLUSION: Participants in this study viewed DCT as a sensible, feasible, and welcome means of avoiding unnecessary self-isolation.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical student's hygiene and practical skills. METHODS: This case-control study assessed the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on hygiene behavior by contrasting the practical skills and hygiene adherence of 371 medical students post the pandemic associated lockdown in March 2020 with that of 355 medical students prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Students' skills were assessed using an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Their skills were then compared based on their results in hygienic venipuncture and the total OSCE score. RESULTS: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, medical students demonstrated an increased level of compliance regarding hand hygiene before (prior COVID-19: 83.7%; during COVID-19: 94.9%; p < 0.001) and after patient contact (prior COVID-19: 19.4%; during COVID-19: 57.2%; p = 0.000) as well as disinfecting the puncture site correctly (prior COVID-19: 83.4%; during COVID-19: 92.7%; p < 0.001). Prior to the pandemic, students were more proficient in practical skills, such as initial venipuncture (prior COVID-19: 47.6%; during COVID-19: 38%; p < 0.041), patient communication (prior COVID-19: 85.9%; during COVID-19: 74.1%; p < 0.001) and structuring their work process (prior COVID-19: 74.4%; during COVID-19: 67.4%; p < 0.024). CONCLUSION: Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic sensitized medical students' attention and adherence to hygiene requirements, while simultaneously reducing the amount of practice opportunities, thus negatively affecting their practical skills. The latter development may have to be addressed by providing additional practice opportunities for students as soon as the pandemic situation allows.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The principal causes of multiorgan failure and death are cytokine release syndrome and immune dysfunction. Stress, anxiety, and depression has been aggravated by the pandemic and its resultant restrictions in day-to-day life which may contribute to immune dysregulation. Thus, immunity strengthening and the prevention of cytokine release syndrome are important for preventing and minimizing mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, despite a few specific remedies that now exist for the SARS-CoV-2virus, the principal modes of prevention include vaccination, masking, and holistic healing methods, such as yoga. Currently, extensive research is being conducted to better understand the neuroendocrinoimmunological mechanisms by which yoga alleviates stress and inflammation. This review article explores the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating potentials of yoga, along with its role in reducing risk for immune dysfunction and impaired mental health. METHODS: We conducted this narrative review from published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE databases. Screening was performed for titles and abstracts by two independent review authors; potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. References of included articles and articles of major non-indexed peer reviewed journals were searched for relevance by two independent review authors. A third review author checked the excluded records. All disagreements were resolved through discussion amongst review authors or through adjudication by a fourth review author. Abstracts, editorials, conference proceedings and clinical trial registrations were excluded. OBSERVATIONS: Yoga is a nonpharmacological, cost-effective, and safe intervention associated with several health benefits. Originating in ancient India, this vast discipline consists of postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation (dhyana/dharana), and relaxation. Studies have demonstrated yoga's ability to bolster innate immunity and to inhibit cytokine release syndrome. As an intervention, yoga has been shown to improve mental health, as it alleviates anxiety, depression, and stress and enhances mindfulness, self-control, and self-regulation. Yoga has been correlated with numerous cardioprotective effects, which also may play a role in COVID-19 by preventing lung and cardiac injury. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This review paves the path for further research on yoga as a potential intervention for enhancing innate immunity and mental health and thus its role in prevention and adjunctive treatment in COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

However, patients rarely discuss their preferences about research and proxies find it challenging to determine what their wishes would be. While the process of informed consent has traditionally been the focus of research to improve consent decisions, the more conceptually complex area of what constitutes 'good' proxy decision-making for research has remained unexplored. Interventions are needed to improve and support proxy decision-making for research but are hampered by a lack of understanding about what constitutes decision quality in this context. A global increase in conditions associated with cognitive impairment such as dementia has led to an urgent need for more research into these conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent necessity to conduct research with large numbers of critically ill patients has made this need even more pressing. Much of the empirical research centres on the desire to improve decision accuracy, despite growing evidence that authenticity is more reflective of the aim of proxy decisions and concerns about the methodological flaws in authenticity-focused studies. Such studies also fail to take account of the impact of decision-making on proxies, or the considerable body of research on improving the quality of healthcare decisions. This paper reports a concept synthesis of the literature that was conducted to develop the first conceptualisation of 'good' proxy decisions about research participation. Elements of decision quality were identified across three stages of decision-making: proxy preparedness for decision-making which includes knowledge and understanding, and values clarification and preference elicitation; the role of uncertainty, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret in the decision-making process; and preference linked outcomes and their effect. This conceptualisation provides an essential first step towards the future development of interventions to enhance the quality of proxy decision-making and ensure proxy decisions represent patients' values and preferences.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

However, willingness to be vaccinated depends on factors beyond the availability of vaccines. The aim of this study was three-folded: to assess children's rates of COVID-19 Vaccination as reported by parents, to explore parents' attitudes towards children's COVID-19 vaccination, and to examine the factors associated with parents' hesitancy towards children's vaccination in several countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive design. A sample of 3744 parents from eight countries, namely, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was conveniently approached and surveyed using Google forms from November to December 2021. The participants have responded to a 42-item questionnaire pertaining to socio-demographics, children vaccination status, knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, and attitudes towards vaccinating children and the vaccine itself. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS- IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. A cross-tabulation analysis using the chi-square test was employed to assess significant differences between categorical variables and a backward Wald stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the independent effect of each factor after controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaccinated children against COVID-19 was 32% as reported by the parents. Concerning parents' attitudes towards vaccines safety, about one third of participants (32.5%) believe that all vaccines are not safe. In the regression analysis, children's vaccination was significantly correlated with parents' age, education, occupation, parents' previous COVID-19 infection, and their vaccination status. Participants aged >/=50 years and those aged 40-50 years had an odds ratio of 17.9 (OR = 17.9, CI: 11.16-28.97) and 13.2 (OR = 13.2, CI: 8.42-20.88); respectively, for vaccinating their children compared to those aged 18-29 years. Parents who had COVID-19 vaccine were about five folds more likely to vaccinate their children compared with parents who did not receive the vaccine (OR = 4.9, CI: 3.12-7.70). The prevalence of children's vaccination in the participating Arab countries is still not promising. CONCLUSION: To encourage parents, vaccinate their children against COVID-19, Arab governments should strategize accordingly. Reassurance of the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine should target the general population using educational campaigns, social media, and official TV and radio channels.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In the UK, anxiety and depression were estimated to affect more than half of perinatal women during the first national lockdown. However, little is known about women's qualitative experiences of distress. This study aimed to extend published quantitative findings resulting from the same data set (Harrison et al., Women Birth xxxx, 2021; Harrison et al., J Reprod Infant Psychol 1-16, 2021) to qualitatively explore: 1) the feelings and symptoms associated with maternal perinatal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) the associated sources of distress. METHODS: As part of an online survey during May 2020, 424 perinatal women responded to an open-ended question regarding a recent experience of distress. Qualitative data were analysed using an initial content analysis, followed by an inductive thematic analysis adopting a realist approach. Data were explored in the context of self-reported perinatal anxiety and depression symptoms. RESULTS: Initial content analysis of the data identified twelve distinct categories depicting participants' feelings and symptoms associated with psychological distress. Despite the high rates of probable depression in the sample, women's descriptions were more indicative of anxiety and general distress, than of symptoms traditionally related to depression. In terms of the associated psychosocial stressors, a thematic analysis identified five themes: Family wellbeing; Lack of support; Mothering challenges; Loss of control due to COVID-19; and Work and finances. Unsurprisingly given the context, isolation was a common challenge. Additionally, psychological conflict between maternal expectations and the reality of pregnancy and motherhood, loss of autonomy and control, and fears surrounding family health, safety, and wellbeing underlay many of the themes. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an array of feelings and symptoms expressed by perinatal mothers which may be useful to consider in relation to perinatal wellbeing.

It's necessary to forecast early warning signals of potential outbreaks of COVID-19, which would facilitate the health ministry to take some suitable control measures timely to prevent or slow the spread of COVID-19. However, since the intricacy of COVID-19 transmission, which connects biological and social systems, it is a difficult task to predict outbreaks of COVID-19 epidemics timely. RESULTS: In this work, we developed a new model-free approach, called, the landscape network entropy based on Auto-Reservoir Neural Network (ARNN-LNE), for quantitative analysis of COVID-19 propagation, by mining dynamic information from regional networks and short-term high-dimensional time-series data. Through this approach, we successfully identified the early warning signals in six nations or areas based on historical data of COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION: Based on the newly published data on new COVID-19 disease, the ARNN-LNE method can give early warning signals for the outbreak of COVID-19. It's worth noting that ARNN-LNE only relies on small samples data. Thus, it has great application potential for monitoring outbreaks of infectious diseases.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Telehealth is increasingly utilized for mental health services to increase access to care and overcome COVID-19 pandemic barriers. Women's perspectives on telehealth services for PD is unknown, however. This study's primary objective was to obtain the perspectives of women who participated in an 8-week group videoconference intervention for PD symptoms, including how technology impacted their experience. METHODS: We utilized theoretical sampling and included perinatal women who had completed the 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral intervention group. Semi-structured focus groups with four to six women were conducted on a videoconference platform. Primary analysis used grounded theory and a secondary analysis used qualitative description and was conducted by two coding teams. The teams collaborated on the final themes across the analyses. RESULTS: Three groups, with a total of 17 participants were conducted. Composition consisted of seven postpartum and ten pregnant women from the 47 total participants. Identified core themes regarding their experiences of the videoconference intervention were: positive experiences, negative experiences, suggestions and ideas, and screening and communication. CONCLUSION: This study provides growing evidence informed by perinatal women of positive experiences with engagement in a videoconference intervention for PD. Telehealth may be a reasonable and acceptable platform to increase access and retention for mental health services in childbearing women.

However, their effectiveness, best dose, duration of treatment and safety remain mostly unidentified. Moreover, recurrence of disease and dose-related side effects are the other issues. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the review is to explore the existing clinical trials for the efficacy of phytochemicals in treating OLP in comparison to corticosteroids. A comprehensive information about their mode of action is also discussed. METHOD: We have discussed different clinical trials conducted on various phytochemicals and plant extracts/formulations like curcumin, lycopene, quercetin, glycyrrhizin, purslane, raspberry, aloe vera gel and aloe vera mouthwash for the treatment of OLP. RESULT: The current therapy for the management of OLP has numerous adverse effects and requires a long-term treatment. Phytochemicals can be a very good alternative in overcoming these side effects and reducing the course of treatment.

With this Covid-19 has created unprecedented challenges in relation to health communication, with the need to reach disadvantaged populations. This systematic scoping review sought to 1) synthesize the existing research regarding communication inequalities in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and 2) analyze the recommendations that emerge from this body of evidence on how to best address these inequalities. This review includes 40 studies that fell into three broad groups (1) those revealing a disadvantage or inequality in studies of general population; (2) those focussing on communication with sub-groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic; and (3) those reporting and evaluating practical attempts to address inequalities. The results largely corroborate those found in past pandemics, highlighting the role of sociodemographic, cultural/religious, and economic factors in facilitating/jeopardizing the public's capacity to access and act upon public health messaging. In a number of studies it was encouraging to see recommendations from the literature - particularly, lessons learnt on the importance of community partnerships, trusted messengers and the co-creation of health and risk messages - being applied, however many challenges remain unmet.

Males, in their 60 s, are more affected with 1.6 new cases/100.000/year. Main risk factors are diabetes, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease. FG is a potentially lethal disease with a rapid and progressive involvement of subcutaneous and fascial plane. A multimodal approach with surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, intensive support care, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is often needed. We present the inpatient management of an FG case during the Covid-19 pandemic period. A narrative review of the Literature searching \"Fournier's gangrene\", \"necrotizing fasciitis\" on PubMed and Scopus was performed. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60 years old man affected by diabetes mellitus, with ileostomy after colectomy for ulcerative colitis, was admitted to our Emergency Department with fever and acute pain, edema, dyschromia of right hemiscrotum, penis, and perineal region. Computed tomography revealed air-gas content and fluid-edematous thickening of these regions. Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index was 9. A prompt broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Imipenem and Daptomycin, surgical debridement of genitalia and perineal region with vital tissue exposure, were performed. Bedside daily surgical wound medications with fibrine debridement, normal saline and povidone-iodine solutions irrigation, iodoform and fatty gauze application, were performed until discharge on the 40(th) postoperative day. Every 3 days office-based medication with silver dressing, after normal saline and povidone-iodine irrigation and fibrinous tissue debridement, was performed until complete re-epithelialization of the scrotum on the 60(th) postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: FG is burdened by a high mortality rate, up to 30%. In the literature, HBOT could improve wound restoration and disease-specific survival. Unfortunately, in our center, we do not have HBOT. Moreover, one of the pandemic period problems was the patient's displacement and outpatient hospital management.

METHOD: Case report. CASE: A 66-year-old male patient with COVID-19 pneumonia received systemic treatments of favipiravir, prednisolone, moxifloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam during hospitalization. The patient applied to our clinic with the complaint of blurred vision 20 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left eye. In the anterior segment examination; ciliary injection, intense pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, pigment deposits on the lens and iris, 2-3 + cells in the anterior chamber, posterior synechia, and 360 degrees diffuse iris transillumination were observed in both eyes. The pupillary response to light was weak. Bilateral fundus examination were normal. In the anterior chamber sample; HSV, VZV, CMV and Toxoplasma PCR were negative. Bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) diagnosed in the patient and topical 0.1% dexamethasone and topical 1% cyclopentolate were started. In the follow-up, visual acuity increased 1.0 in both eyes, there were no cells in the anterior chamber, and the pigment dispersion was still continuing despite a decrease.

The tendency in 2021 confirmed that of prior years, with fewer urgent transplants and a preference for the use of ventricular assist devices. The remaining characteristics and survival showed a clear trend toward stability in the last decade. Compared with 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2020 and 2021) did not affect short- or long-term survival. Conclusions In 2021, transplant activity returned to prepandemic levels. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic did not significantly affect transplant outcomes. The main transplant features and outcomes have clearly stabilized in the last decade.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples in off-label collection media and External Quality Assessment (EQA) samples were dual tested: first using either the RealStar(R) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay or the QIAstat-Dx(R) Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel and then using the NeuMoDx Assay. Samples found to be positive for respiratory viruses and negative for SARS-CoV-2 were then tested using the NeuMoDx Assay to assess cross-reactivity. RESULTS: Overall, 274 samples (244 patient and 30 EQA samples) were dual tested: 154 were SARS-CoV-2 positive; 120 were negative. No false positive or false negative results were identified, regardless of collection media used: the NeuMoDx Assay sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.63-100.00) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI: 96.97-100.00).

METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey data were collected March to April 2021. The survey was distributed to public health workers who worked in a state, tribal, local, or territorial public health department since March 2020. RESULTS: In total, 26,174 United States state and local public health workers completed the survey. Feeling isolated was a risk factor for anxiety (PR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.74-1.95), depression (PR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.75-1.94), post-traumatic stress disorder (PR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.43-1.57), and suicidal ideation (PR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.82-3.69). The ability to take time off was linked to fewer reported symptoms of anxiety (PR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83-0.90), depression (PR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89), post-traumatic stress disorder (PR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88), and suicidal ideation (PR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92).

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of additional vaccinations. METHODS: In this prospective study, humoral (anti-S RBD) and cellular (Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)) immune responses were determined after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in 106 LTR after a third, and in 36 LTR after a fourth vaccination. Patients with anti-S RBD antibody levels >0.8 AU/mL after vaccination were defined as responders. RESULTS: After three vaccinations, 92% (97/106) of LTR compared to 100% (28/28) of HC were responders. However, the antibody titer of LTR was lower compared to HC (1891.0 vs. 21857.0 AU/mL, p<0.001). Between a second and third vaccination (n=75) the median antibody level increased 67-fold in LTR. In patients seronegative after two vaccinations, a third dose induced seroconversion in 76% (19/25), while all HC were already seropositive after two vaccinations. A spike-specific T-cell response was detected in 72% (28/39) after a third compared to 32% (11/34) after a second vaccination. Independent risk factors for a low antibody response (anti-S RBD <100 AU/mL) were first vaccination within the first year after LT (OR: 8.00, p=0.023), eGFR <45 mL/min (OR: 4.72, p=0.006), and low lymphocyte counts (OR: 5.02, p=0.008). A fourth vaccination induced a 9-fold increase in the median antibody level and seroconversion in 60% (3/5) of previous non-responders. CONCLUSION: A third and fourth SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectively increases the humoral and cellular immune response of LTR, but to a lesser extent than in HC. A fourth vaccination should be generally considered in LTR.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

With the known association between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and myocarditis, an understanding of pre-pandemic rates of SrSCD due to myocarditis will be important in assessing a change of risk in the future. The objective was to ascertain the incidence of SrSCD or aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) attributable to myocarditis in the general population. METHODS: A literature search through PubMed/Medline and Ovid/EMBASE was completed. Studies of SrSCD with autopsy data or clear cause aborted SrSCD were included. SrSCD was defined as SCD which occurred within 1 hour of exercise. Data were abstracted by two independent reviewers using the MOOSE guidelines. Risk assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Random effects models were used to report the incidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was the incidence of SrSCD attributable to myocarditis, and the secondary outcome was SrSCD overall. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included comprising 347,092,437 person-years (PY). There were 1955 SrSCD or aborted SrSCD overall with an incidence of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.47 to 1.82) per 100,000 PY. Fifty-three SrSCD were attributed to myocarditis with an incidence of 0.047 (95% CI: 0.018 to 0.123) per 100,000 PY or 1 death attributable to myocarditis in 2.13 million PY.

Due to their immune-evasive potential and the resulting significance for public health, close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) is required to evaluate the regulation of early local countermeasures. In this study, we demonstrate a rapid workflow for wastewater-based early detection and monitoring of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoCs Omicron in the end of 2021 at the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Emschermuendung (KLEM) in the Federal State of North-Rhine-Westphalia (NRW, Germany). Initially, available primers detecting Omicron-related mutations were rapidly validated in a central laboratory. Subsequently, RT-qPCR analysis of purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed in a decentral PCR laboratory in close proximity to KLEM. This decentralized approach enabled the early detection of K417N present in Omicron in samples collected on 8th December 2021 and the detection of further mutations (N501Y, Delta69/70) in subsequent biweekly sampling campaigns. The presence of Omicron in wastewater was confirmed by next generation sequencing (NGS) in a central laboratory with samples obtained on 14th December 2021. Moreover, the relative increase of the mutant fraction of Omicron was quantitatively monitored over time by dPCR in a central PCR laboratory starting on 12th December 2021 confirming Omicron as the dominant variant by the end of 2021. In conclusions, WBE plays a crucial role in surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants and is suitable as an early warning system to identify variant emergence. In particular, the successive workflow using RT-qPCR, RT-dPCR and NGS demonstrates the strength of WBE as a versatile tool to monitor variant spreading.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

To assess the cerebral counterpart to this condition, we carried out an EEG experiment, extracting Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) evoked by emotional faces with and without surgical masks. Besides the expected impairment in emotion recognition in both accuracy and response times, also the classical face-related ERPs (N170 and P2) are altered by the presence of surgical masks.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective ecological study was conducted using data from patients hospitalized for KD as well as infectious diseases surveillance reports in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, during 2015-2020. We defined the periods before and after the onset of pandemic as January 2015-March 2020 and as April 2020-December 2020, respectively. We compared the reductions in the incidence of KD among six administrative regions in the prefecture according to the density of the populations. RESULTS: A total of 1,290 patients with KD were identified. The incidence of KD (per 100,000 person-years) was significantly reduced after the COVID-19 pandemic onset (period before pandemic onset, 105.6 [95% CI: 99.8, 111.8]; period after pandemic onset, 68.6 [95% CI: 56.7, 83.0]). During the period after pandemic onset, the incidence of KD was significantly reduced in May, compared with the corresponding period in previous years. The number of patients aged 2-4 years was significantly reduced after the pandemic onset. Notably, greater reductions in the incidence of KD were found in regions with lower population densities.

While it is increasingly recognized that lipids have important structural and signaling roles in platelets, the lipidomic landscape of platelets during infection has remained unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the platelet lipidome of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed untargeted lipidomics in platelets of 25 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and 23 noninfectious controls with similar age and sex characteristics, and with comparable comorbidities. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the 1,650 annotated lipids were significantly different between the groups. The significantly altered part of the platelet lipidome mostly comprised lipids that were less abundant in patients with COVID-19 (20.4% down, 4.6% up, 75% unchanged). Platelets from COVID-19 patients showed decreased levels of membrane plasmalogens, and a distinct decrease of long-chain, unsaturated triacylglycerols. Conversely, platelets from patients with COVID-19 displayed class-wide higher abundances of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and its biosynthetic precursor lysophosphatidylglycerol. Levels of these classes positively correlated with ex vivo platelet reactivity-as measured by P-selectin expression after PAR1 activation-irrespective of disease state. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this investigation provides the first exploration of the profound impact of infection on the human platelet lipidome, and reveals associations between the lipid composition of platelets and their reactivity. These results warrant further lipidomic research in other infections and disease states involving platelet pathophysiology.", "CI": ["The Author(s).

On the contrary, round consolidations with the halo sign are considered uncommon and are typically found in fungal infections, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The authors recently observed several patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with round, multifocal consolidations accompanied by a halo sign. As this may indicate alterations of CT morphology based on the virus variant, the aim of this study was to investigate this matter in more detail. METHODS: 161 CT scans of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR within 2 days of CT) examined between January 2021 and September 15, 2021 were included. Follow-up examinations, patients with invasive ventilation at the time of CT, and patients with insufficient virus typing for variants of concern (VOC) were excluded. CT scans were assessed for vertical and axial distribution of pulmonary patterns, degree of involvement, uni- vs. bilaterality, reticulations, and other common findings. The mean density of representative lesions was assessed in Hounsfield units. Results were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests, Student's t-rests, descriptive statistics, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: 75 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. Therefore, 86/161 CT scans of unique patients were analyzed. PCR VOC testing confirmed manifestation of the Delta-VOC SARS-CoV-2 in 22 patients, 39 patients with Alpha-VOC and the remaining 25 patients with Non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections. Three patients with the Delta-VOC demonstrated multiple pulmonary masses or nodules with surrounding halo sign, whereas no patients with either Alpha-VOC (p = 0.043) or non-VOC (p = 0.095) demonstrated these findings. All three patients were admitted to normal wards and had no suspicion of a pulmonary co-infection. Patients with Delta-VOC were less likely to have ground glass opacities compared to Alpha-VOC (7/22 or 31.8 % vs. 4/39 or 10.3 %; p < 0.001), whereas a significant difference has not been observed between Delta-VOC and non-VOC (5/25 or 20 %; p = 0.348). The mean representative density of lesions did not show significant differences between the studied cohorts. CONCLUSION: In this study 3 out of 22 patients (13.6 %) with Delta-VOC presented with bilateral round pulmonary masses or nodules with surrounding halo signs, which has not been established as a notable imaging pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia yet. Compared to the other cohorts, a lesser percentage of patients with Delta-VOC presented with ground glass opacities. Based on these results Delta-VOC might cause a divergence in CT-morphologic phenotype. KEY POINTS: . Until recently, CT-morphologic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia have been presumed to be uncontroversially understood. Yet, recently the authors observed diverging pulmonary alterations in patients infected with Delta-VOC.. . These imaging alterations included round pulmonary masses or nodules with surrounding halo sign.. . These imaging alterations have not yet been established as typical for COVID-19 pneumonia, yet.. . Based on these results, Delta-VOC could impose a divergence of CT-morphologic phenotype.. CITATION FORMAT: . Yuksel C, Sahn M, Kleines M et al.

In this study we analysed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using the data from the annual balance sheet of a university department and maximum care provider for orthopaedics and trauma surgery. METHODS: Data analysis was performed on the clinic's performance parameters from 2019 and 2020. The analysis included 52943 outpatient and 7980 inpatient cases, together with the Case Mix Index (CMI), and the costs and revenues. RESULTS: As a result of the reduction in scheduled surgeries, the mean number of inpatients in March and April 2020 decreased by 10.4% (p = 0.004). Due to the focus on complex cases, the CMI increased by 29.5% (p = 0.007). The number of outpatient surgical procedures increased by 16.9% (n = 84). Rising costs of consumables due to the purchase of protective equipment were offset by a reduced need for orthopaedic implants. CONCLUSION: By reducing the number of elective inpatient surgical treatments, the focus was shifted to treating complex cases; this is reflected in the increased CMI. Due to internal compensation mechanisms, the clinic was able to conserve intensive care capacities while still achieving an increase in revenue.", "CI": ["Thieme.

Both mRNA (BNT162b2 [Fosun Pharma-BioNTech]) and inactivated CoronaVac (Sinovac, Beijing, China) vaccines are widely available; however, vaccination coverage has been low, particularly in older adults aged 70 years or older. We aimed to assess vaccine effectiveness in this predominantly infection-naive population. METHODS: In this observational study, we used individual-level case data on mild or moderate, severe or fatal, and fatal disease in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 along with census information and coverage data of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. We used a negative binomial model, adjusting for age, sex, and calendar day to estimate vaccine effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of both BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines, and relative effectiveness by number of doses and vaccine type. FINDINGS: Between Dec 31, 2021, and March 16, 2022, 13.2 million vaccine doses were administered in Hong Kong's 7.4-million population. We analysed data from confirmed cases with mild or moderate (n=5566), severe or fatal (n=8875), and fatal (n=6866) COVID-19. Two doses of either vaccine protected against severe disease and death within 28 days of a positive test, with higher effectiveness among adults aged 60 years or older with BNT162b2 (vaccine effectiveness 89.3% [95% CI 86.6-91.6]) compared with CoronaVac (69.9% [64.4-74.6]). Three doses of either vaccine offered very high levels of protection against severe or fatal outcomes (97.9% [97.3-98.4]). INTERPRETATION: Third doses of either BNT162b2 or CoronaVac provide substantial additional protection against severe COVID-19 and should be prioritised, particularly in older adults older than 60 years and others in high-risk populations who received CoronaVac primary schedules. Longer follow-up is needed to assess duration of protection across different vaccine platforms and schedules.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this form of therapy is particularly challenged, as it relies heavily on group therapies. The aim of the study was to find out what impact the pandemic has had on oncological rehabilitation so far and how the rehabilitation clinics have dealt with it. METHODS: A web-based survey was used to collect data from 14 oncological rehabilitation clinics on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on occupancy, staffing trends and hygiene measures for the observation period from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021. The data were compared with the same period one year earlier. In addition, the compensatory measures taken with regard to therapy were recorded. RESULTS: While only 15272 patients were rehabilitated in the period under review, 21257 patients were rehabilitated in the same period one year earlier. This corresponds to a decrease in occupancy of 28%. Three clinics were affected by temporary closures due to the pandemic. In 39% of the clinics, screening tests for patients had already been started for more than 8 months, while this was also offered to staff in only 23% of the clinics. With regard to changes in the therapeutic offer, more physiotherapeutic small groups with a reduced number of participants were used. This was also used in the area of sports therapy and education offers by 73% and 60% of the clinics respectively. Overall, 92% of the participants assumed an economic recovery at the time of the survey. CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable decrease in occupancy in the oncological rehabilitation clinics, the therapies could be changed and carried out in a hygiene-compliant manner. Screening tests were offered at an early stage for patients as well as somewhat delayed for staff.

The evidence showed that heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome that could be encountered at different stages during the progression of COVID-19. Shenfu injection (SFI), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has been widely used for heart failure therapy in China and was suggested to treat critical COVID-19 cases based on the guideline for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (the 7th version) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. However, the active components, potential targets, related pathways, and underlying pharmacology mechanism of SFI against COVID-19 combined with HF remain vague. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and possible pharmacological mechanism of SFI for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 combined with HF. METHODS: In the current study, a network analysis approach integrating active compound screening (drug-likeness, lipophilicity, and aqueous solubility models), target fishing (Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology, fingerprint-based Similarity Ensemble Approach, and PharmMapper databases), compound-target-disease network construction (Cytoscape software), protein-protein interaction network construction (STRING and Cytoscape software), biological process analysis (STRING and Cytoscape plug-in Clue GO) and pathway analysis (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis) was developed to decipher the active ingredients, potential targets, relevant pathways, and the therapeutic mechanisms of SFI for preventing and treating COVID-19 combined with HF. RESULTS: Finally, 20 active compounds (DL >/= 0.18, 1</=Alog P </= 5, and -5</=LogS </= -1) and 164 relevant targets of SFI were identified related to the development of COVID-19 combined with HF, which were mainly involved in three biological processes including metabolic, hemostasis, and cytokine signaling in immune system. The C-T-D network and reactome pathway analysis indicated that SFI probably regulated the pathological processes of heart failure, respiratory failure, lung injury, and inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19 combined with HF through acting on several targets and pathways. Moreover, the venn diagram was used to identify 54 overlapped targets of SFI, COVID-19, and HF. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that 54 overlapped targets were highly enriched to several COVID-19 and HF related pathways, such as IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive network analysis approach framework was developed to systematically elucidate the potential pharmacological mechanism of SFI for the prevention and treatment of SFI against COVID-19 combined with HF. The current study may not only provide in-depth understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of SFI, but also a scientific basis for the application of SFI against COVID-19 combined with HF.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

While the benefits of using them as a tool have been extensively discussed, the online activity of various healthcare organizations on SMPs during COVID-19 in terms of engagement and sentiment forecasting has not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research is to analyze the nature of information shared on Twitter, understand the public engagement generated on it, and forecast the sentiment score for various organizations. METHODS: Data was collected from the Twitter handles of five pharmaceutical companies, ten U.S. and Canadian public health agencies, and World Health Organization (WHO) between January 01, 2017 - December 31, 2021. A total of 181,469 tweets were divided into two phases for the analysis: before COVID-19 and during COVID-19, based on the confirmation of the first COVID-19 community transmission case in North America on February 26, 2020. We conducted content analysis to generate health-related topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based topic modeling techniques, analyzed public engagement on Twitter, and performed sentiment forecasting using 16 univariate moving-average and machine learning (ML) models to understand the correlation between public opinion and tweet contents. RESULTS: We utilized the topics modeled from the tweets authored by the health organizations chosen for our analysis using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) ('c_umass' scores: -3.6530 and -3.7944, before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 respectively). The topics are - 'Chronic Diseases', 'Health Research', 'Community Healthcare', 'Medical Trials', 'COVID-19', 'Vaccination', 'Nutrition and Well-being', and 'Mental Health'. In terms of user impact, WHO (user impact: 4171.24) had the highest impact overall, followed by the public health agencies, CDC (user impact: 2895.87), and NIH (user impact: 891.06). Among pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer's user impact was the highest at 97.79. Furthermore, for sentiment forecasting, ARIMA and SARIMAX models performed best on the majority of the subsets of data (divided as per the health organization and time-period), with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between 0.027 - 0.084, Mean Squared Error (MSE) between 0.001 - 0.011, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between 0.031 - 0.105. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people engage more on topics like 'COVID-19' than 'Medical Trials', 'Customer Experience'. Also, there are notable differences in the user engagement levels across organizations. Global organizations, like WHO, show wide variations in engagement levels over time. The sentiment forecasting method discussed presents a way for organizations to structure their future content to ensure maximum user engagement.

Defined as the use of technology (synchronous or asynchronous) to support communication between healthcare providers and patients, rural-urban differences in virtual are relatively unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The two-fold purpose of the present study was to examine rural and urban virtual care access, use, and satisfaction during the pandemic and to identify any unmet needs. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey exploring virtual care among rural and urban adults in summer 2021 using a combination of fixed and open-ended response options. Quantitative data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using inductive thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 501 (373, 74.4% female; Age 19-86 years; 237, 47.3% rural-living) Western Canadians completed the survey. Virtual care use was high among both rural (171/237, 72.2%) and urban (188/264, 71.2%) participants, with over half reporting having only started to use virtual care since the pandemic. The self-reported need for mental health programs and services increased during the pandemic compared to prior for both rural and urban participants. Among virtual care users, interest in its continuation was high. Our analysis also shows that internet quality (all Ps<.05) and eHealth literacy (all Ps<.001) were positively associated with participants' perceptions of virtual care usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction with no rural/urban differences. Rural participants were less likely to have used video in communicating with doctors/healthcare providers, compared to urban participants (P<.001). When describing unmet needs, participants described: 1) lack of access to care; 2) limited health promotion and prevention options; and 3) lack of mental health service options. CONCLUSIONS: The increased demand for and use of virtual care may reflect increased availability and a lack of alternatives due to limited in-person services during the COVID-19 pandemic, so a balance between virtual care and in-person care is important to consider post-pandemic. Further, ensuring availability of high-speed internet and education to support patients will be important for providing accessible and effective virtual care, especially for rural residents.

The Omicron variant contains as many as 26 unique mutations of effects not yet determined (Venkatakrishnan, A., Open Science Framework, 2021). Out of its total of 34 Spike protein mutations, 15 are located on the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) (Stanford Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database, 2022) that directly contacts the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor and is also a primary target for antibodies. Here, we studied the binding mode of the S-RBD domain of the Spike protein carrying the Omicron mutations and the globular domain of human ACE2 using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified new and key Omicron-specific interactions such as R(493) (of mutation Q493R), which forms salt bridges both with E(35) and D(38) of ACE2, Y(501) (N501Y), which forms an edge-to-face aromatic interaction with Y(41), and Y(505) (Y505H), which makes an H-bond with E(37) and K(353). The glycan chains of ACE2 also bind differently in the WT and Omicron variants in response to different charge distributions on the surface of Spike proteins. However, while the Omicron mutations considerably improve the overall electrostatic fit of the two interfaces, the total number of specific and favorable interactions between the two does not increase. The dynamics of the complexes are highly affected too, making the Omicron S-RBD:ACE2 complex more rigid; the two main interaction sites, Patches I and II, isolated in the WT complex, become connected in the Omicron complex through the alternating interaction of R(493) and R(498) with E(35) and D(38).", "FAU": ["Fazekas, Zsolt", "Menyhard, Dora K", "Perczel, Andras"], "AU": ["Fazekas Z", "Menyhard DK", "Perczel A"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0001-5007-4807", "ORCID: 0000-0002-0095-5531", "ORCID: 0000-0003-1252-6416"], "AD": ["Laboratory of Structural Chemistry and Biology, Institute of Chemistry, ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary.", "ELTE Hevesy Gyorgy PhD School of Chemistry, ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary.", "Laboratory of Structural Chemistry and Biology, Institute of Chemistry, ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary.", "MTA-ELTE Protein Modeling Research Group, Eotvos Lorand Research Network (ELKH), ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary.", "Laboratory of Structural Chemistry and Biology, Institute of Chemistry, ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary.", "MTA-ELTE Protein Modeling Research Group, Eotvos Lorand Research Network (ELKH), ELTE Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest 1117, Hungary."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Chem Inf Model", "JT": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "JID": "101230060", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/19 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/18 15:22"], "PHST": ["2022/07/18 15:22 [entrez]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00397 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Chem Inf Model. 2022 Jul 18. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00397."}, {"PMID": "35849732", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1744-5078 (Electronic) 0927-3948 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 18", "TI": "Optic Neuritis Following the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in a Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Uncovering the Diagnosis of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders.", "PG": "1-3", "LID": "10.1080/09273948.2022.2089901 [doi]", "AB": "COVID-19 vaccinations have been given worldwide to save the lives of millions.

Traditionally, developing a targeted assay for peptide quantification has involved manually preselecting several fragment ions and establishing a limit of detection (LOD) and a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for confident detection of the target. Established thresholds such as LOD and LLOQ, however, inherently sacrifice sensitivity to afford specificity. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning can be applied to qualitative PRM assays to discriminate positive from negative samples more effectively than a traditional approach utilizing conventional methods. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we trained an ensemble machine learning model using 282 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 994 SARS-CoV-2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swab) analyzed using a targeted PRM method. This model was then validated using an independent set of 200 positive and 150 negative samples and achieved a sensitivity of 92% relative to results obtained by RT-PCR, which was superior to a traditional approach that resulted in 86.5% sensitivity when analyzing the same data.

OBJECTIVE: We present a machine learning approach leveraging passive sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers of people with MS to predict their health outcomes in a natural experiment during a state-mandated \"stay-at-home\" period due to a global pandemic. METHODS: First, we extract features that capture behavioral changes due to the \"stay-at-home\" order. Then, we adapt and apply an existing algorithm to these behavioral change features to predict the presence of depression, high global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality during the \"stay-at-home\" period. RESULTS: Using data collected between November 2019 and May 2020, algorithm detects depression with an accuracy of 82.5% (65% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.84), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 90% (39% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.93), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 75.5% (22% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.80), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 84% (28% improvement over baseline; f1-score: 0.84).

Being able to predict mutations that could arise in SARS-CoV-2 leading to increased transmissibility or immune evasion would be extremely valuable in development of broad-acting therapeutics and vaccines, and prioritising viral monitoring and containment. Here we use in vitro evolution to seek mutations in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that would substantially increase binding to ACE2. We find a double mutation, S477N and Q498H, that increases affinity of RBD for ACE2 by 6.5-fold. This affinity gain is largely driven by the Q498H mutation. We determine the structure of the mutant-RBD:ACE2 complex by cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the mechanism for increased affinity. Addition of Q498H to SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants is found to boost binding affinity of the variants for human ACE2 and confer a new ability to bind rat ACE2 with high affinity. Surprisingly however, in the presence of the common N501Y mutation, Q498H inhibits binding, due to a clash between H498 and Y501 side chains. To achieve an intermolecular bonding network, affinity gain and cross-species binding similar to Q498H alone, RBD variants with the N501Y mutation must acquire instead the related Q498R mutation. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 RBD can access large affinity gains and cross-species binding via two alternative mutational routes involving Q498, with route selection determined by whether a variant already has the N501Y mutation. These mutations are now appearing in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants where they have the potential to influence human-to-human and cross-species transmission.", "FAU": ["Bate, Neil", "Savva, Christos G", "Moody, Peter C E", "Brown, Edward A", "Evans, Sian E", "Ball, Jonathan K", "Schwabe, John W R", "Sale, Julian E", "Brindle, Nicholas P J"], "AU": ["Bate N", "Savva CG", "Moody PCE", "Brown EA", "Evans SE", "Ball JK", "Schwabe JWR", "Sale JE", "Brindle NPJ"], "AD": ["Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, Leicester United Kingdom.", "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, Leicester United Kingdom.", "Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.", "Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.", "Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.", "Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, Leicester United Kingdom.", "School of Life Sciences, The University of Nottingham, Nottingham United Kingdom.", "Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.", "Division of Protein & Nucleic Acid Chemistry, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.", "Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, Leicester United Kingdom.", "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, Leicester United Kingdom."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS Pathog", "JT": "PLoS pathogens", "JID": "101238921", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/19 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/18 13:44"], "PHST": ["2022/02/25 00:00 [received]", "2022/07/10 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/18 13:44 [entrez]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.ppat.1010733 [doi]", "PPATHOGENS-D-22-00368 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "PLoS Pathog. 2022 Jul 18;18(7):e1010733. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010733."}, {"PMID": "35849631", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1553-7358 (Electronic) 1553-734X (Linking)", "VI": "18", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022 Jul 18", "TI": "Drug repurposing based on a quantum-inspired method versus classical fingerprinting uncovers potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.", "PG": "e1010330", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010330 [doi]", "AB": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviral therapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a Quadratic Unbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar to Remdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in the DrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The two methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. While GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predicted BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy against several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an in vitro polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed from those predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compounds inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both models being useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively small comparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complex problems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of possible combinations to evaluate.

METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness framework to evaluate societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to six health-related indirect effects of COVID-19 in California. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated for the adult population. We identified one evidence-based mitigation strategy for each condition and estimated QALYs gained, intervention costs, and savings from averted health-related harms. Model data were derived from literature review, public data, and expert opinion. RESULTS: Pandemic-associated increases in prevalence across these six conditions were estimated to lead to over 192,000 QALYs lost and to approach $7 billion in societal costs per million population over the life course of adults. The greatest costs and QALYs lost per million adults were due to adult depression. All mitigation strategies assessed saved both QALYs and costs, with five strategies achieving savings within one year. The greatest net savings over 10 years would be achieved by addressing depression ($242 million) and excessive alcohol use ($107 million).

However, it is unclear how this increased strain translates into help-seeking behavior. Here, we aim to characterize those individuals who seek help for COVID-19 related psychological distress, and examine which factors are associated with their levels of distress in order to better characterize vulnerable groups. METHODS: We report data from 1269 help-seeking participants subscribing to a stepped-care program targeted at mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sample characteristics were compared to population data, and linear regression analyses were used to examine which risk factors and stressors were associated with current symptom levels. RESULTS: Seeking for help for COVID-19 related psychological distress was characterized by female gender, younger age, and better education compared to the general population. The majority reported mental health problems already before the pandemic. 74.5% of this help-seeking sample also exceeded clinical thresholds for depression, anxiety, or somatization. Higher individual symptom levels were associated with higher overall levels of pandemic stress, younger age, and pre-existing mental health problems, but were buffered by functional emotion regulation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a considerable increase in demand for mental-healthcare in the pandemic aftermath. Comparisons with the general population indicate diverging patterns in help-seeking behavior: while some individuals seek help themselves, others should be addressed directly. Individuals that are young, have pre-existing mental health problems and experience a high level of pandemic stress are particularly at-risk for considerable symptom load.

The technology is based on Raman spectroscopy and computational analysis. It does not detect SARS-CoV-2 virus or viral components, but rather a urine 'molecular fingerprint', representing systemic metabolic, inflammatory, and immunologic reactions to infection. We analyzed voided urine specimens from 46 symptomatic COVID-19 patients with positive real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for infection or household contact with test-positive patients. We compared their urine Raman spectra with urine Raman spectra from healthy individuals (n = 185), peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 20), and patients with active bladder cancer (n = 17), collected between 2016-2018 (i.e., pre-COVID-19). We also compared all urine Raman spectra with urine specimens collected from healthy, fully vaccinated volunteers (n = 19) from July to September 2021. Disease severity (primarily respiratory) ranged among mild (n = 25), moderate (n = 14), and severe (n = 7). Seventy percent of patients sought evaluation within 14 days of onset. One severely affected patient was hospitalized, the remainder being managed with home/ambulatory care. Twenty patients had clinical pathology profiling. Seven of 20 patients had mildly elevated serum creatinine values (>0.9 mg/dl; range 0.9-1.34 mg/dl) and 6/7 of these patients also had estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73m2 (range 59-84 mL/min/1.73m2). We could not determine if any of these patients had antecedent clinical pathology abnormalities. Our technology (Raman Chemometric Urinalysis-Rametrix(R)) had an overall prediction accuracy of 97.6% for detecting complex, multimolecular fingerprints in urine associated with COVID-19 disease. The sensitivity of this model for detecting COVID-19 was 90.9%. The specificity was 98.8%, the positive predictive value was 93.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. In assessing severity, the method showed to be accurate in identifying symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe (random chance = 33%) based on the urine multimolecular fingerprint. Finally, a fingerprint of 'Long COVID-19' symptoms (defined as lasting longer than 30 days) was located in urine. Our methods were able to locate the presence of this fingerprint with 70.0% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity in leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. Further validation testing will include sampling more patients, examining correlations of disease severity and/or duration, and employing metabolomic analysis (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry [GC-MS], High Performance Liquid Chromatography [HPLC]) to identify individual components contributing to COVID-19 molecular fingerprints.", "FAU": ["Robertson, John L", "Senger, Ryan S", "Talty, Janine", "Du, Pang", "Sayed-Issa, Amr", "Avellar, Maggie L", "Ngo, Lacey T", "Gomez De La Espriella, Mariana", "Fazili, Tasaduq N", "Jackson-Akers, Jasmine Y", "Guruli, Georgi", "Orlando, Giuseppe"], "AU": ["Robertson JL", "Senger RS", "Talty J", "Du P", "Sayed-Issa A", "Avellar ML", "Ngo LT", "Gomez De La Espriella M", "Fazili TN", "Jackson-Akers JY", "Guruli G", "Orlando G"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4361-999X", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1365-4831"], "AD": ["Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics, College of Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Section of Nephrology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Department of Biological Systems Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Clinical Biomechanics and Orthopedic Medicine, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Department of Statistics, College of Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Department of Biological Systems Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "DialySensors Incorporated, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America.", "Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.", "Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.", "Internal Medicine/Infectious Disease, Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America.", "Division of Surgical Urology/Urologic Oncology, Department of Surgery, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, United States of America.", "Department of Surgery, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States of America."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "COIS": ["I have read the journal's policy and authors of this manuscript (JR, RS, PD) have", "the following competing interest.

The overarching objective of the current research was to explore the views and experiences of families in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, who were living in the Republic of Ireland, including in areas designated as disadvantaged. In Study 1, the objective was to explore changes, difficulties, and concerns experienced by parents of children up to six years old during the pandemic, and related associations with socio-demographic characteristics. Data were collected from 168 parents/carers via an online questionnaire, and examined using conceptual content analysis. The most frequently identified experiences related to restrictions, social isolation, negative impacts on parents' emotional and psychological well-being, negative impacts on children's emotional well-being and development, concerns with physical health, uncertainty about the future, and positive changes regarding family time and activities. Associations were found with parents' age and work situation, and family's income and composition. In Study 2, the objective was to explore the views of children, parents, and service providers about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on families' life, and relevant supports. Data were collected from 50 children aged between eight and 17 years old, 17 parents, and 20 service providers through focus group discussions, and examined using thematic analysis. The participants reported experiences related to challenges with online education, uncertainty regarding children's education, food poverty, and children's socio-emotional health.

Considering Austria as an example, here we show that this dynamics can be captured by a time-independent, i.e. autonomous, compartmental model that incorporates these capacity limits. In this model, the epidemic acceleration coincides with the exhaustion of mitigation efforts, resulting in an increasing fraction of undetected cases that drive the effective reproduction rate progressively higher.

To address this knowledge gap, we investigate the prevalence and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection (either symptomatic or not) and disease in 5 years-old Amazonian children. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively estimated SARS-CoV-2 attack rates and the proportion of infections leading to COVID-19-related illness among 660 participants in a population-based birth cohort study in the Jurua Valley, Amazonian Brazil. Children were physically examined, tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, and had a comprehensive health questionnaire administered during a follow-up visit at the age of 5 years carried out in January or June-July 2021. We found serological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in 297 (45.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41.2-48.9%) of 660 cohort participants, but only 15 (5.1%; 95% CI, 2.9-8.2%) seropositive children had a prior medical diagnosis of COVID-19 reported by their mothers or guardians. The period prevalence of clinically apparent COVID-19, defined as the presence of specific antibodies plus one or more clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell) reported by their mothers or guardians since the pandemic onset, was estimated at 7.3% (95% CI, 5.4-9.5%). Importantly, children from the poorest households and those with less educated mothers were significantly more likely to be seropositive, after controlling for potential confounders by mixed-effects multiple Poisson regression analysis. Likewise, the period prevalence of COVID-19 was 1.8-fold (95%, CI 1.2-2.6-fold) higher among cohort participants exposed to food insecurity and 3.0-fold (95% CI, 2.8-3.5-fold) higher among those born to non-White mothers. Finally, children exposed to household and family contacts who had COVID-19 were at an increased risk of being SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and-even more markedly-of having had clinically apparent COVID-19 by the age of 5 years.

As travelling to meetings and conferences was almost completely suppressed for most of healthcare professionals, e-Learning became increasingly prominent. The overall utility of e-Learning during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its shortcomings in the international community of vascular surgery were assessed through the EL-COVID study. Regional variability was observed amongst participating nations, which is currently being addressed through several ongoing subgroup analyses. Our study completes the aforementioned efforts and aims to investigate the adherence and adoption of vascular e-Learning in Germany. Methods and participants: Using an online survey, EL-COVID gathered answers from 856 vascular surgeons, of whom 70 were located in Germany. We analyzed the answers of 62 German responders that attended at least one e-Learning activity and compared them with the remaining worldwide data. Results: Out of all European countries, Germany was best represented and ranked second worldwide after Mainland China (n=109). 30.6 percent of the German responders were female (vs. 20% worldwide; p=0.048) and 56.4% were vascular surgeons with >5 years of practice (vs. 56.3; p=0.975). The international cohort generally engaged in more e-Learning. Most German participants attended less than 4 online activities, while only 24.2% took part in more than 4 such events (vs. 56.3; p<0.0001). While the overall impression of e-Learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic was positive, German employers were less supportive of participation during working hours (30.6% vs. 44%; p=0.042). The main reason for not attending was lack of time due to increased workload (56.5% vs. 50%; p=0.328). National and international societies played a lesser role in promoting such activities in Germany (22.6% vs. 39.2%; p=0.010), the same accounts for social media (16.1 vs. 30.3; p=0.017). Conclusions: E-Learning complements the classical training methods and has been embraced as a relevant alternative in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this survey appeal to German employers and national societies to improve support and dissemination of e-Learning activities in the vascular medicine community.", "FAU": ["Trenner, Matthias", "Patelis, Nikolaos", "Bartos, Oana"], "AU": ["Trenner M", "Patelis N", "Bartos O"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0001-7076-9526", "ORCID: 0000-0003-2328-2162", "ORCID: 0000-0003-3828-1680"], "AD": ["Department of Vascular Medicine, St. Josefs Hospital, Wiesbaden, Germany.", "Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Germany.", "The authors contributed equally.", "Third Department of Vascular Surgery, Athens Medical Center, Greece.", "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.", "The authors contributed equally.", "Department of Vascular Medicine, St. Josefs Hospital, Wiesbaden, Germany."], "CN": ["EL-COVID collaborators"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "Switzerland", "TA": "Vasa", "JT": "VASA.

Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mask use has been expanded to all public areas to help slow the spread of this virus. One such location where masks can be seen is gyms. While exercising, the needs of the body are altered due to the increased stress being placed upon it. Normal physiology is thus adjusted to meet these new demands and to maintain optimal functioning. Therefore, it is possible that adding a mask covering the mouth and nose while exercising could further exacerbate this physiologic alteration, causing potential concerns. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to identify the impact of mask use on normal perceived physiology (breathing, heart rate, temperature, exertion, stamina, and quality of workout) within the exercising population. METHODS: To obtain data focused on the research question, a self-reporting, online, anonymous Qualtrics survey was administered in local gyms and social media outlets. A total of 280 total participants were recruited between the ages of 18 and 65 who have ever exercised while wearing a mask. All results were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A Cronbach's alpha was also calculated to check internal validity. The significance level utilized was p</=0.05. RESULTS: Completion of a Kruskal-Wallis test revealed statistical significance regarding the perception of masks in general and the participants' rating of the perceived physiological parameters (breathing: p<0.001; heart rate: p<0.001; temperature: p<0.001; exertion: p<0.001; stamina: p<0.001; and quality of workout: p<0.001), the duration of time the mask was utilized during the workout, and the participants' rating of the perceived physiological parameters (breathing: p=0.001; heart rate: p=0.020; temperature: p<0.001; exertion: p<0.001; stamina: p=0.001; quality of workout: p<0.001; and perception of mask: p<0.001), and the change in the number of days that the participants exercised per week during the pandemic as well as some of the participants' ratings of the perceived physiological parameters (breathing: p=0.042; exertion: p=0.015; stamina: p=0.027; and quality of workout: p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Any alterations to normal physiology perception while exercising with a mask appear to be psychological and adaptive in nature.

This relationship has not yet been investigated within the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and within low-income and racially/ethnically diverse urban student populations, who are facing increased stress. METHOD: Via an online survey, this study assessed material and social stressors and symptom endorsements for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTS), within a public university student sample at two time points, April 8 through May 2, 2020; n = 2,925; and July 9 through July 31, 2020; n = 1,073; during the pandemic. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses assessed the relationship between each diagnostic symptom category and stressor category scores. Analyses yielded stronger associations for total social stressor score and probable anxiety (beta = .695, SE = .046, p < .001 in April, beta = .730, SE = .085, p < .001 in July), probable depression (beta = .655, SE = .045, p < .001 in April, beta = .676, SE = .080, p < .001 in July) and probable PTS (beta = .587, SE = .045, p < .001 in April, beta = .687, SE = .083, p < .001 in July), compared with total material stressor scores, total material and social stressor scores. CONCLUSION: Such findings highlight the burden of both stressor types, but particularly social stress, on psychological health for underresourced students, and emphasize the need for targeted interventions that increase social assets.

Following infection, the early expressed viral protein NSP1 binds the ribosome, represses translation, and induces mRNA degradation, while the host elicits an anti-viral response. The mechanisms enabling viral mRNAs to escape this multifaceted repression remain obscure. Here we show that expression of NSP1 leads to destabilization of multi-exon cellular mRNAs, while intron-less transcripts, such as viral mRNAs and anti-viral interferon genes, remain relatively stable. We identified a conserved and precisely located cap-proximal RNA element devoid of guanosines that confers resistance to NSP1-mediated translation inhibition. Importantly, the primary sequence rather than the secondary structure is critical for protection. We further show that the genomic 5'UTR of SARS-CoV-2 drives cap-independent translation and promotes expression of NSP1 in an eIF4E-independent and Torin1-resistant manner. Upon expression, NSP1 further enhances cap-independent translation. However, the sub-genomic 5'UTRs are highly sensitive to eIF4E availability, rendering viral propagation partially sensitive to Torin1. We conclude that the combined NSP1-mediated degradation of spliced mRNAs and translation inhibition of single-exon genes, along with the unique features present in the viral 5'UTRs, ensure robust expression of viral mRNAs. These features can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Contextual findings showed a tension at the heart of Indore's growth-Indore's great success as a city has spurred rapid population growth. This growth creates pressure on municipal systems as population outpaces service delivery capacity. This is central to the systems map that BHC developed and is expanded upon through additional patterns that fall within four main domains: (1) leadership, governance, and financing; (2) essential service delivery and workforce; (3) information systems; and (4) community infrastructure and education. Stakeholders found three key leverage opportunities within this context that, if included in every action, could help overcome barriers. These opportunities are: (1) improving data quality, use, and integration; (2) supporting accountability to, and enforcement of, policies and regulations; and (3) increasing community engagement. Brought together through a better understanding of the key patterns driving system behavior from the context map and leverage opportunities, BHC was able to co-create, with stakeholders, seven \"coherent actions\" to move Indore to a healthier, more equitable state.

Pain symptoms can be initiated by direct viral damage to the tissue or by indirect tissue injury followed by nociceptor sensitization. The most common types of pain that are reported to occur in COVID-19 patients are headache, myalgia, and chest pain. With more and more cases coming in the hospitals, many new and unique symptoms of pain are being reported. Testicular and abdominal pain are rare cases of pain that are also being reported and are associated with COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) which acts as an entry point for the virus. ACE-2/ Ang II/AT 1 receptor also participates directly in the transmission of pain signals from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It induces a series of complicated responses in the human body. Among which the cytokinetic storm and hypercoagulation are the most prominent pathways that mediate the sensitization of sensory neurons facilitating pain. The elevated immune response is also responsible for the activation of inflammatory lipid mediators such as COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). PG molecules especially PGE2 and PGD2 are involved in the pain transmission and are found to be elevated in COVID-19 patients. Though arachidonic acid pathway is one of the lesser discussed topics in COVID-19 pathophysiology, still it can be useful for explaining the unique and rarer symptoms of pain seen in COVID-19 patients. Understanding different pain pathways is very crucial for the management of pain and can help healthcare systems to end the current pandemic situation.

Vaccines have helped in reducing disease severity and transmission but their long-term effects on health and effectiveness against future viral variants remain unknown. COVID-19 pathogenesis involves alteration in iron homeostasis. Thus, a contextual understanding of iron-related parameters would be very valuable for disease prognosis and therapeutics.Accordingly, we reviewed the status of iron and iron-related proteins in COVID-19. Iron-associated alterations in COVID-19 reported hitherto include anemia of inflammation, low levels of serum iron (hypoferremia), transferrin and transferrin saturation, and high levels of serum ferritin (hyperferritinemia), hepcidin, lipocalin-2, catalytic iron, and soluble transferrin receptor (in ICU patients). Hemoglobin levels can be low or normal, and compromised hemoglobin function has been proposed. Membrane-bound transferrin receptor may facilitate viral entry, so it acts as a potential target for antiviral therapy. Lactoferrin can provide natural defense by preventing viral entry and/or inhibiting viral replication. Serum iron and ferritin levels can predict COVID-19-related hospitalization, severity, and mortality. Serum hepcidin and ferritin/transferrin ratio can predict COVID-19 severity. Here, serum levels of these iron-related parameters are provided, caveats of iron chelation for therapy are discussed and the interplay of these iron-related parameters in COVID-19 is explained.This synopsis is crucial as it clearly presents the iron picture of COVID-19. The information may assist in disease prognosis and/or in formulating iron-related adjunctive strategies that can help reduce infection/inflammation and better manage COVID-19 caused by future variants. Indeed, the current picture will augment as more is revealed about these iron-related parameters in COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of online structured oral examination (SOE) in radiology clerkships. The study identifies measures taken to successfully implement online SOE and minimize chances of cheating. It also discusses the challenges encountered and how they were addressed. METHODS: SOE percent scores of fourth-year medical students from two institutions were correlated with students' grade point average (GPA). The scores were compared among different institutions, students' genders, students' batches, examination versions, and examiners with different experience levels. Students' perceived satisfaction and concerns were captured using anonymous self-administered questionnaire. Technical problems and success rate of SOE implementation were recorded. Results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: A total of 79 students participated in the study, out of which 81.0% (n = 64) responded to the survey. SOE scores showed poor positive correlation with the students' GPAs (r = 0.22, and p = .09). Scores showed no significant difference between the two institutions or genders. Scores were also not significantly different between students who were examined by junior or senior examiners. All but one version of examination showed no significant difference in students' scores. No significant difference was observed in students' scores between each two subsequent batches who were exposed to the same examination version. CONCLUSION: Online summative SOE is a feasible alternative whenever face-to-face SOE could not be implemented provided that appropriate measures are taken to ensure its successful execution.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Although there are prophylactic vaccines being used, till now, there is ongoing research into discovery of drug candidates for total eradication of all types of coronaviruses. In this context, this study sought to investigate the inhibitory effects of six selected tropical plants against four pathogenic proteins of Coronavirus-2. The medicinal plants used in this study were selected based on their traditional applications in herbal medicine to treat COVID-19 and related symptoms. The biological activities (antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory activities) of the extracts of the plants were assessed using different standard procedures. The phytochemicals present in the extracts were identified using GCMS and further screened via in silico molecular docking. The data from this study demonstrated that the phytochemicals of the selected tropical medicinal plants displayed substantial binding affinity to the binding pockets of the four main pathogenic proteins of Coronavirus-2 indicating them as putative inhibitors of Coronavirus-2 and as potential anti-coronavirus drug candidates. The reaction between these phytocompounds and proteins of Coronavirus-2 could alter the pathophysiology of COVID-19, thus mitigating its pathogenic reactions/activities. In conclusion, phytocompounds of these plants exhibited promising binding efficiency with target proteins of SARS-COV-2.

Results revealed a significant increase in parents' stress and state anxiety during the pandemic compared to before, but not in their children. Dyads' anxiety sensitivity remained unchanged, as well as parents' use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Children showed similar use of cognitive reappraisal, but less expressive suppression and co-rumination during the pandemic compared to before. Children reported similar perceived social support from all sources over time. Finally, parental and children scores were not significantly correlated at either time.

We examined how assistance networks of older adults changed in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these changes differed for those with and without dementia. METHODS: We used three rounds of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. We estimated multinomial logistic regression models to test whether changes in assistance networks during COVID-19 (2019-2020) - defined as expansion, contraction, and adaptation - differed from changes prior to COVID-19 (2018-2019). We also estimated OLS regression models to test differences in numbers of helpers assisting with one (specialist) vs. multiple (generalist) domains before and during COVID-19. For both sets of outcomes, we investigated whether pandemic-related changes differed for those with and without dementia. RESULTS: Over all activity domains, a greater proportion of assistance networks adapted during COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (RRR = 1.19, p < .05). Contractions in networks occurred for those without dementia. Transportation assistance contracted for those with and without dementia, and mobility/self-care assistance contracted for those with dementia. The average number of generalist helpers decreased during COVID-19 (beta = -0.09, p < .001). DISCUSSION: Early in the pandemic, assistance networks of older adults adapted by substituting helpers, by contracting to reduce exposures with more intimate tasks for recipients with dementia, and by reducing transportation assistance. Future research should explore the impact of such changes on the well-being of older adults their assistance networks.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

The current general practice of assessing serology assay performance by overall concordance in a qualitative manner may not detect the presence of analytical shift/drift that could affect disease classifications. METHODS: We describe an approach to defining bias specifications for qualitative serology assays that considers minimum positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). Desirable minimum PPVs and NPVs for a given disease prevalence are projected as equi-PPV and equi-NPV lines into the receiver operator characteristic curve space of coronavirus disease 2019 serology assays, and the boundaries define the allowable area of performance (AAP). RESULTS: More stringent predictive values produce smaller AAPs. When higher NPVs are required, there is lower tolerance for negative biases. Conversely, when higher PPVs are required, there is less tolerance for positive biases. As prevalence increases, so too does the allowable positive bias, although the allowable negative bias decreases. The bias specification may be asymmetric for positive and negative direction and should be method specific. CONCLUSIONS: The described approach allows setting bias specifications in a way that considers clinical requirements for qualitative assays that measure signal intensity (eg, serology and polymerase chain reaction).", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

This disparity was further intensified by the constantly changing and sometimes opposing health and safety guidelines and recommendations to businesses from the local, state, and federal government agencies. To better understand how the pandemic has impacted small businesses, a cross-sectional survey was administered to owners, managers, and workers (n = 45) in the beauty and auto shop sectors from Southern Arizona. The survey identified barriers to safe operation that these businesses faced during the pandemic, illuminated worker concerns about COVID-19, and elicited perceptions of how workplaces have changed since the novel coronavirus outbreak of 2019. A combination of open-ended and close-ended questions explored how businesses adapted to the moving target of pandemic safety recommendations, as well as how the pandemic affected businesses and workers more generally. Almost all the beauty salons surveyed had to close their doors (22/25), either temporarily or permanently, due to COVID-19, while most of the auto repair shops were able to stay open (13/20). Beauty salons were more likely to implement exposure controls meant to limit transmission with customers and coworkers, such as wearing face masks and disallowing walk-ins, and were also more likely to be affected by pandemic-related issues, such as reduced client load and sourcing difficulties. Auto shops, designated by the state of Arizona to be 'essential' businesses, were less likely to have experienced financial precarity due to the pandemic. Content analysis of open-ended questions using the social-ecological model documented current and future worker concerns, namely financial hardships from lockdowns and the long-term viability of their business, unwillingness of employees to return to work, uncertainty regarding the progression of the pandemic, conflict over suitable health and safety protocols, and personal or family health and well-being (including anxiety and/or stress). Findings from the survey indicate that small businesses did not have clear guidance from policymakers during the pandemic and that the enacted regulations and guidelines focused on either health and safety or finances, but rarely both.

PURPOSE: To assess the quality of critical care clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) involving pharmacotherapy recommendations. METHODS: A systematic electronic search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for critical care CPGs published between 2012 and 2022 and involving pharmacotherapy recommendations. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument was employed to appraise CPG quality through independent assessment by 2 appraisers. RESULTS: Twenty-one CPGs were evaluated. The number of recommendations in each guideline ranged from 2 to 250, with a total of 1,604 recommendations. The number of strong (vs weak) recommendations in each guideline ranged from 0 to 31, with a total of 116 strong recommendations, or 7.23% of the total number of recommendations. There was at least 1 pharmacist author for 9 (43%) of the guidelines. The AGREE II domains for which mean quality scores of evaluated guidelines were highest were scope and purpose (0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.92), rigor of development (0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.83), clarity of presentation (0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.87), and editorial independence (0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94), while those for which mean scores were lowest were stakeholder involvement (0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and applicability (0.49; 95% CI, 0.43-0.55). Involvement of a pharmacist in CPG development was associated with significantly higher scoring for stakeholder involvement (P = 0.0356). CONCLUSION: Strong recommendations accounted for less than 10% of the recommendations in the evaluated CPGs. Moreover, there are concerns related to guideline applicability (ie, advice or tools for putting recommendations into practice) and stakeholder involvement (ie, inclusion of individuals from all relevant groups). It is important to involve pharmacists in CPGs with pharmacotherapy recommendations.", "CI": ["(c) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2022. All rights reserved.

An immune correlate of protection (CoP) is a CoR that can be used to reliably predict vaccine efficacy (VE) against the clinical endpoint and hence is accepted as a surrogate endpoint that can be used for accelerated approval or guide use of vaccines. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CoR analysis is limited by not assessing a causal vaccine effect. To address this limitation, we construct the controlled risk curve of a biomarker, which provides the causal risk of an endpoint if all participants are assigned vaccine and the biomarker is set to different levels. Furthermore, we propose a causal CoP analysis based on controlled effects, where for the important special case that the biomarker is constant in the placebo arm, we study the controlled vaccine efficacy curve that contrasts the controlled risk curve with placebo arm risk. We provide identification conditions and formulae that account for right censoring of the clinical endpoint and two-phase sampling of the biomarker, and consider G-computation estimation and inference under a semiparametric model such as the Cox model. We add modular approaches to sensitivity analysis that quantify robustness of CoP evidence to unmeasured confounding. We provide an application to two phase 3 trials of a dengue vaccine indicating that controlled risk of dengue strongly varies with 50$\\%$ neutralizing antibody titer.

OBJECTIVES: To study the pharmacokinetic inter-individual variability of remdesivir and its main metabolite GS-441524 in a real-world setting of COVID-19 inpatients and to identify possible associations with different demographic/biochemical variables. METHODS: Inpatients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, undergoing standard-dose remdesivir treatment, were prospectively enrolled. Blood samples were collected on day 4, immediately after (C0) and at 1 h (C1) and 24 h (C24) after infusion. Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations were measured using a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method and the AUC0-24 was calculated. At baseline, COVID-19 severity (ICU or no ICU), sex, age, BMI and renal and liver functions were assessed. Transaminases and estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) were also evaluated during treatment. Linear regression, logistic regression and multiple linear regression tests were used for statistical comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters and variables. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were included. The mean (CV%) values of remdesivir were: C0 2091 (99.1%) ng/mL, C1 139.7 (272.4%) ng/mL and AUC0-24 2791 (175.7%) ng.h/mL. The mean (CV%) values of GS-441524 were: C0 90.2 (49.5%) ng/mL, C1 104.9 (46.6%) ng/mL, C24 58.4 (66.9) ng/mL and AUC0-24 1976 (52.6%) ng.h/mL. The multiple regression analysis showed that age (P < 0.05) and e-GFR (P < 0.01) were independent predictors of GS-441524 plasma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a high interpatient variability of remdesivir and GS-441524 likely due to both age and renal function in COVID-19 inpatients. Further research is required to understand whether the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites may influence drug-related efficacy or toxic effect.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Since, more than 200 cases from United Kingdom and hundreds more from all across the world have been reported. The majority of affected children were younger than six years of age. The clinical presentation was nonspecific with diarrhoea and vomiting usually preceding the appearance of jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea and malaise. Approximately 10% have required liver transplantation. An infectious aetiology has been considered likely given the epidemiological and clinical features of the reported cases. More than 60% of the children tested were diagnosed with adenovirus infection although a clear aetiological connection has still to be demonstrated. No link with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine was found. What is not clear to date is whether the high number of acute hepatitis cases reported is related to a true increase in incidence or heightened awareness following on from the initial reports from the United Kingdom.

Relevant studies were searched in the PubMed, Medline, and SciELO electronic databases. Search filters were used to include reports after 2020 and cohort studies. RESULTS: In total, 1166 articles were identified and 55 English-written articles were included based on the risk of bias. Of all COVID-19-hospitalized patients presenting with AKI (n = 18029) classified as Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 to 3, approximately 18% required mechanical ventilation and 39.2 % died. Around 11.3% of the patients required kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and of these, 1093 died and 321 required continuous KRT. Death is more frequent in individuals with AKI [OR 6.03, 95%CI: 5.73-6.74; p<0.01]. Finally, mechanical ventilation is an aggravating factor in the clinical conditions studied [OR 11.01, 95%CI: 10.29-11.77; p<0.01]. CONCLUSION: Current literature indicates AKI as an important complication in COVID-19. In this context, we observed that comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease and heart failure, were more related to the development of AKI. In addition, mechanical ventilation was seen as an aggravating factor in this scenario.", "FAU": ["Silva, Beatriz Moreira", "Assis, Leticia Cristina Silva De", "Batista Junior, Mauricio De Castro", "Gonzalez, Naara Affonso Philipps", "Anjos, Samuel Benni Dos", "Goes, Miguel Angelo"], "AU": ["Silva BM", "Assis LCS", "Batista Junior MC", "Gonzalez NAP", "Anjos SBD", "Goes MA"], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5735-406X", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9495-5454", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4515-1625", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1005-6158", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1972-7416", "ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7687-3826"], "AD": ["Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi Das Cruzes, SP, Brasil.", "Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi Das Cruzes, SP, Brasil.", "Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi Das Cruzes, SP, Brasil.", "Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi Das Cruzes, SP, Brasil.", "Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes, Mogi Das Cruzes, SP, Brasil.", "Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil."], "LA": ["eng", "por"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "Brazil", "TA": "J Bras Nefrol", "JT": "Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia", "JID": "9426946", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/19 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/18 08:02"], "PHST": ["2022/01/21 00:00 [received]", "2022/05/03 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/18 08:02 [entrez]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["S0101-28002022005038401 [pii]", "10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2022-0013en [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Bras Nefrol. 2022 Jul 15. pii: S0101-28002022005038401. doi: 10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2022-0013en."}, {"PMID": "35848601", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1447-0594 (Electronic) 1447-0594 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 18", "TI": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on services for community-dwelling adults and people with dementia, and their families' intentions to use those services.", "LID": "10.1111/ggi.14440 [doi]", "FAU": ["Kazawa, Kana", "Kubo, Tatsuhiko", "Akishita, Masahiro", "Ishii, Shinya"], "AU": ["Kazawa K", "Kubo T", "Akishita M", "Ishii S"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5303-8542", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8822-9181", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5498-7224", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5762-4066"], "AD": ["Department of Medicine for Integrated Approach to Social Inclusion, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.", "Department of Public Health and Health Policy, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.", "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.", "Department of Medicine for Integrated Approach to Social Inclusion, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan."], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["21K07317/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C)"], "PT": ["Letter"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "Japan", "TA": "Geriatr Gerontol Int", "JT": "Geriatrics & gerontology international", "JID": "101135738", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/19 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/18 07:13"], "PHST": ["2022/06/26 00:00 [revised]", "2022/04/09 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/30 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/18 07:13 [entrez]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1111/ggi.14440 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Geriatr Gerontol Int. 2022 Jul 18. doi: 10.1111/ggi.14440."}, {"PMID": "35848574", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1399-3062 (Electronic) 1398-2273 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 18", "TI": "Outcomes of Bebtelovimab and Sotrovimab Treatment of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 during the Omicron Epoch.", "LID": "10.1111/tid.13901 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) are at high-risk for severe infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-spike monoclonal antibodies are currently utilized under emergency use authorization to prevent hospitalization in high-risk individuals with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), including SOTRs. However, clinical data for bebtelovimab, the sole currently available anti-spike monoclonal antibody for COVID-19, is limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult SOTRs diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 from January 2022 through May 2022 who received either bebtelovimab or sotrovimab. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 361 SOTRs, 92 (25.5%) received bebtelovimab and 269 (74.5%) received sotrovimab. The most common organ transplant was kidney (42.4%). SOTRs who received bebtelovimab had a higher proportion who had received a booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose and had received their last vaccination dose more recently. Eleven (3.0%) SOTRs were hospitalized, and rates of hospitalization were similar between monoclonal antibody groups (3.3% versus 3.0%; p>0.99). Three patients required admission to an intensive care unit, all who received sotrovimab. Four (1.1%) patients died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, two from each group. CONCLUSIONS: SOTRs with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who received bebtelovimab had similar rates of COVID-19-related hospitalization as those who received sotrovimab. While differences in vaccination rates and viral subvariants could act as confounders, bebtelovimab appears to be of similar effectiveness as sotrovimab. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN: Time-series analysis. METHODS: We analyzed the IQVIA Real World Data-Longitudinal Prescriptions Database and calculated time trends in the weekly number of persons with active antiretroviral (ARV) prescriptions for HIV treatment, and of persons who obtained ARV prescriptions during January 2017-March 2021. We used interrupted time-series models to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antiretroviral therapy (ART) use between March 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: We found that the weekly number of persons with active ARV prescriptions decreased by an average 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.8% to -1.1%), compared to predicted use, during March 2020 through March 2021. The weekly number of persons who obtained ARV prescriptions decreased 4.5% (95% CI: -6.0% to -3.0%), compared to the predicted number. Men, persons aged </=34 years, privately insured persons, and persons in medication assistance programs had greater decreases than other groups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a decrease in the number of persons with active ARV prescriptions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the number did not return to levels expected in the absence of the pandemic.

DESIGN: We included men with HIV on ART in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who, between February 2020 and October 2021, were 18 years or older and had adequate virological control, CD4+ cell count, and HIV viral load measured in the previous 12 months, and no previous COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination. METHODS: We compared the adjusted risks of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-related hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission by baseline ART regimen: tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC, abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), and other. We fit pooled logistic regressions to estimate the 18-month risks standardized by demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Among 20 494 eligible individuals, the baseline characteristics were similar across regimens, except that TDF/FTC and TAF/FTC had lower prevalences of chronic kidney disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min. Compared with TAF/FTC, the estimated 18-month risk ratio (95% confidence interval) of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.65 (0.43, 0.89) for TDF/FTC, 1.00 (0.85, 1.18) for ABC/3TC, and 0.87 (0.70, 1.04) for others. The corresponding risk ratios for COVID-19 hospitalization were 0.43 (0.07, 0.87), 1.09 (0.79, 1.48), and 1.21 (0.88, 1.62). The risk of COVID-19 ICU admission was lowest for TDF/FTC, but the estimates were imprecise. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that, in men living with HIV, TDF/FTC may protect against COVID-19-related events.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an objective method to diagnose and evaluate PPPD.Objective: To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on elderly PPPD patients and define the relationship between prefrontal alpha rhythm asymmetry (FAA) by Electroencephalography (EEG) and PPPD.Methods: This case-control study was conducted to discuss the differences of elderly outpatients (>60 years) with PPPD during the peak period of COVID-19 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019, and collect the prefrontal FAA value in PPPD during COVID-19 outbreak, which were compared to its FAA in healthy control.Results: Compared with the same period in 2019, the number of elderly PPPD patients during the epidemic period in 2020 increased significantly (16.4%, p = 0.000, x(2) =31.802) . The left alpha wave signal power (F3) was significantly higher than the right alpha wave signal power (F4) (Z=-3.073, p = 0.002).

This study investigated the changes and factors associated with vaccination intentions in various epidemic situations, which can provide suggestions for the construction and modification of routine vaccination program strategies. METHODS: Two cross-sectional online surveys were conducted in January and June of 2021. The willingness and confidence of the COVID-19 vaccination were measured following propensity score matching (PSM) treatment. The difference in the willingness for COVID-19 Vaccination in the two surveys was analyzed by single or multi-factor analyses. RESULTS: The willingness to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was higher in the second survey than that in the first survey (90.5% VS 66.6%, p<0.001). Concerns about the vaccine's safety declined (71.0% VS 47.6%, p<0.001), but concerns about the efficacy increased (22.4% VS 30.9%, p<0.001). Confidence in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine had an important impact on the increased uptake willingness (OR=3.19, 95%CI: 2.23-4.58, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant increase in attitudes towards the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which was associated with higher vaccine confidence. Vaccine effectiveness received more concerns from respondents rather than safety after nearly 6 months' utilization of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. It indicates that aggressive communication and timely disclosure of vaccine data can build vaccine confidence. This article is protected by copyright.

While physicians and nurses are the public face of those experiencing burnout in hospitals, these stressors also affect low-wage workers such as food and housekeeping/janitorial service workers whose roles largely remain \"invisible\" when conceptualizing the essential health workforce and understanding their needs. This study sought to understand the experiences of frontline essential workers to better support them and prevent burnout. METHODS: Using a semi-structured interview guide, we conducted 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with workers in three U.S. states. Thematic content analysis was conducted to code and analyze interviews. RESULTS: Workers had an average of 5.8 years in their jobs, which included food services, housekeeping/janitorial, and patient transport roles. Analysis revealed four prominent stressors contributing to worker burnout: changes in duties and staff shortages, fear of contracting or transmitting COVID-19, desire for recognition of their job-related risk, and unclear communication on safety precautions and resources. Protective factors included paid time-off, mental health supports, sense of workplace pride, and self-coping strategies. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: As health systems continue to grapple with care delivery in the context of COVID-19, identifying best practices to support all workers and prevent burnout is vital to the functioning and safety of hospitals. Further consideration is warranted to create policies and multipronged interventions to meet workers' tangible needs while shifting the culture, so all members of the health workforce are seen and valued.", "FAU": ["Zerden, Lisa de Saxe", "Richman, Erica L", "Lombardi, Brianna", "Forte, Alexandria B"], "AU": ["Zerden LS", "Richman EL", "Lombardi B", "Forte AB"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4436-4407"], "AD": ["School of Social Work, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.", "Cecil G.

Objectives: To describe the context and circumstances of deaths of PWD within a dementia support program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Retrospective data collection of PWD deaths between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Setting/Subjects: Decedents enrolled in Care Ecosystem, a multidisciplinary team model for dementia care at University of California San Francisco, Ochsner Health, and UCHealth. Measurements: Using mixed methods, we analyzed data using descriptive measures and team-based thematic analysis to understand the end-of-life (EOL) experience of PWD-caregiver dyads. Results: Twenty-nine PWD died across three sites. Almost half (45%) were between ages 70-79 and 12 (41%) were women. Eighteen (62%) died at a private residence; two died in the hospital. Hospice was involved for 22 (76%) patients. There were known causes of death for 15 (53%) patients. Only two deaths were directly related to COVID-19 infection. Social isolation was perceived to have a high or very high impact for 12 (41%) decedents. Four qualitative themes were identified: (1) isolation due to the pandemic, (2) changes in use of dementia supports and resources, (3) impact on goals of care decisions, and (4) communication challenges for EOL care coordination. Conclusion: Among PWD and caregivers enrolled in a dementia support program, the COVID-19 pandemic had direct and indirect influences on mortality and EOL experiences of PWD.

Moreover, persistent pain is increasingly recognised as a key manifestation of long COVID. This narrative review explores the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for chronic pain. Publications were identified related to the COVID-19 pandemic influence on the burden of chronic pain, development of new-onset pain because of long COVID with proposed mechanisms and COVID-19 vaccines and pain interventions. Broadly, mechanisms underlying pain due to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be caused by 'systemic inflammatory-immune mechanisms', 'direct neuropathic mechanisms' or 'secondary mechanisms due to the viral infection or treatment'. Existing chronic pain populations were variably impacted and social determinants of health appeared to influence the degree of effect. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the absolute numbers of patients with pain and headache. In the acute phase, headache as a presenting symptom predicted a milder course. New-onset chronic pain was reportedly common and likely involves multiple mechanisms; however, its prevalence decreases over time and symptoms appear to fluctuate. Patients requiring intensive support were particularly susceptible to long COVID symptoms. Some evidence suggests steroid exposure (often used for pain interventions) may affect vaccine efficacy, but there is no evidence of clinical repercussions to date. Although existing chronic pain management could help with symptomatic relief, there is a need to advance research focusing on mechanism-based treatments within the domain of multidisciplinary care.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Association of Anaesthetists."], "FAU": ["Shanthanna, H", "Nelson, A M", "Kissoon, N", "Narouze, S"], "AU": ["Shanthanna H", "Nelson AM", "Kissoon N", "Narouze S"], "AD": ["Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.", "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care, University of California Irvine, Orange, CA, USA.", "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.", "Center for Pain Medicine, Western Reserve Hospital, Cuyahoga Falls, OH, USA."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20220718", "PL": "England", "TA": "Anaesthesia", "JT": "Anaesthesia", "JID": "0370524", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "chronic pain", "long COVID", "pain practice", "post-acute COVID-19 syndrome"], "EDAT": "2022/07/19 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/18 05:23"], "PHST": ["2022/06/22 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/18 05:23 [entrez]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1111/anae.15801 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Anaesthesia. 2022 Jul 18. doi: 10.1111/anae.15801."}, {"PMID": "35848374", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1524-8399 (Print) 1524-8399 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 17", "TI": "Black & Mild: A Tutorial, After the CDC.", "PG": "15248399221099441", "LID": "10.1177/15248399221099441 [doi]", "AB": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that smoking causes ~480,000 U.S. deaths annually.

Despite the scientific progression made in the development of the vaccine, there is an urgent need for the discovery of antiviral drugs for better performance at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) plays a pivotal role in the life cycle of the virus, making it an attractive target for the development of antiviral agents effective against the new strains of coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, a series of apigenin-based natural biflavonoid derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronaviruses 3CLpro was investigated by in silico approaches. For this purpose, the molecular docking was performed to analyze the interaction of the natural biflavonoids with SARS-Cov-2 main protease and for further investigation, docking to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Based on docking scores and comparison with the reference inhibitors (ritonavir and lopinavir), more than half of the biflavonoids had strong interactions with the residues of the binding pocket of the coronaviruses 3CLpro and exhibited better binding affinities toward the main protease than ritonavir and lopinavir. The top biflavonoids were further explored through molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy calculation and residual energy contributions estimated by the MM-PBSA. Also, drug likeness property investigation by Swiss ADME tools and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The results confirmed that the 3CLpro-amentoflavone, 3CLpro-bilobetin, 3CLpro-ginkgetin, and 3CLpro-sotetsuflavone complexes possess a large amount of dynamic properties such as high stability, significant binding energy and fewer conformation fluctuations. Also, the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness studies and HOMO-LUMO and DFT descriptor values indicated a promising result of the selected natural biflavonoids. Overall findings indicate that the apigenin-based biflavonoids may inhibit COVID-19 by significant interactions in the binding pocket and those results can pave the way in drug discovery although the effectiveness of these bioactive compounds should be further validated by in-vitro and in-vivo investigations.

We used the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the open conformation of the Spike protein to assess the impact of the mutations observed in the variants of concern at the molecular level. Molecular dynamics were subsequently performed with both the wt and the mutated forms to compare the flexibility and variation data for each residue of the three-dimensional fluctuations in the region associated with each alpha carbon. Additionally, protein-protein docking was used to investigate the interaction of each mutated profile with the ACE-2 receptor. After the molecular dynamics, the results show that the mutations increased the stability of the trimeric protein, with greater stability observed in the Gamma variant harboring the 10 characteristic mutations. The results of molecular dynamics, as shown by RMSF demonstrated for the residues that comprise the binding domain receptor (RBD), exhibited a reduction in flexibility, which was more pronounced in the Gamma variant. Finally, protein-protein docking experiments revealed an increase in the number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds in the Gamma variant against the ACE-2 receptor, as opposed to the other variants. Taken together, these in silico experiments suggest that the evolution of the mutations favored the increased stability of Spike protein while potentially improving its interaction with the ACE-2 receptor, which in turn may indicate putative structural outcomes of the selection of these mutations in the convergent adaptive evolution as it has been observed for SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To control the pandemic and to achieve herd immunity, four vaccines have obtained market authorization in Europe. Researchers have reported that the sequence of administration of the vaccines depends on the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and age, recommending the vaccine to pregnant and breastfeeding women. RESEARCH AIM: To examine the knowledge, willingness and attitudes of breastfeeding women in Spain regarding the possibility of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: An observational descriptive cross-sectional study in two tertiary-level hospitals from Valencia was conducted. Breastfeeding women (N = 301) were recruited by non-probability sampling of consecutive cases. Questionnaires were collected in June 2021. RESULTS: More than one in every two participants would accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and the percentage rose in participants who were older, more educated, or worked in high-risk jobs. Their main source of information was the Internet, and midwives were the professionals who most recommended vaccination. Participants who would not accept vaccination during lactation reported reasons linked to lack of information regarding vaccination in their condition and how it might affect newborns.

This study measured the secondary attack rates (SARs) and relative risk (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic index cases as compared with symptomatic index cases. METHODS: We used COVID-19 test results, daily health check reports, and contact tracing data to measure SARs and corresponding RRs among close contacts of index cases in a cohort of 12 960 young adults at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana for 103 days, from August 10 to November 20, 2020. Further analysis included Fisher exact tests to determine the association between symptoms and COVID-19 infection and z tests to determine statistical differences between SARs. RESULTS: Asymptomatic rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were higher (SAR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.14-0.24) than was estimated in prior studies, producing an RR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.54-1.07) when compared with symptomatic transmission. In addition, the transmission rate associated with presymptomatic cases (SAR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.21-0.30) was approximately the same as that for symptomatic cases (SAR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.19-0.31). Furthermore, different symptoms were associated with different transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are a risk for community spread of COVID-19, especially with new variants emerging. Moreover, typical symptom checks may easily miss people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic but still infectious.

The objective of this study was to characterize COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake in a community-based sample of people who inject drugs in Baltimore, Maryland. METHODS: The ALIVE study (AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience) in Baltimore is a community-based cohort study of people with a history of injection drug use. From March 2 through June 28, 2021, 346 ALIVE participants completed a survey on substance use, structural determinants of health, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The exposure of interest was COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and the primary outcome was vaccination status as of June 30, 2021. We extracted data on the dates of vaccination from electronic medical records linked to study participants. RESULTS: The median age of the sample was 60 years; most participants were male (66%) and non-Hispanic Black (87%). Most (55%) trusted the COVID-19 vaccine, and 68% had received >/=1 dose. After age standardization, survey participants were more likely than the Maryland general population to be unvaccinated (prevalence ratio = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.97-1.49; P = .10). Participants who somewhat trusted or did not trust the COVID-19 vaccine had 6-fold higher odds of being unvaccinated than participants who trusted the vaccine (odds ratio = 6.30; 95% CI, 3.74-10.60).

We conducted a school investigation to assess layouts and physical distancing in classroom settings with and without in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We assessed, measured, and mapped 90 K-12 (kindergarten through grade 12) classrooms in 3 Missouri public school districts during January-March 2021, prior to widespread prevalence of the Delta variant; distances between students, teachers, and people with COVID-19 and their contacts were analyzed. We used whole-genome sequencing to further evaluate potential transmission events. RESULTS: The investigation evaluated the classrooms of 34 students and staff members who were potentially infectious with COVID-19 in a classroom. Of 42 close contacts (15 tested) who sat within 3 ft of possibly infectious people, 1 (2%) probable transmission event occurred (from a symptomatic student with a longer exposure period [5 days]); of 122 contacts (23 tested) who sat more than 3 ft away from possibly infectious people with shorter exposure periods, no transmission events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced student physical distancing is one component of mitigation strategies that can allow for increased classroom capacity and support in-person learning.

It was aimed to investigate whether ABO blood group type affects the prognosis and mortality rates in patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU (intensive care unit) of a tertiary-level hospital in Turkey. METHODS: The data of 273 patients with diagnosis of severe COVID-19 who were admitted to ICU from April 2020 through June 2021 and in an age range between 25-93 years were evaluated in this retrospective study. RESULTS: Blood group distribution was 47.3%, 13.2%, 10.6% and 28.9% for groups A, B, AB, and O, respectively. As a respiratory status at admission to ICU; the ratio of intubation patients with blood type O was significantly higher than of other groups while most of patients in group A achieved spontaneous respiration without any mechanical ventilator (P = 0.0168). The mean neutrophil ratio, NLR, concentrations of procalcitonin, lactate, urea and ferritin significantly increased in the serum of patients with type O (P < 0.01 for all except P = 0.016 for the ferritin). The weaning duration was longest among patients with blood group O while the hospitalization duration was longest among patients with group AB, however, there was not significant difference (P > 0.05). The highest mortality rate was calculated in group AB as 68.97% and lowest was 47.2% in group B without any statistical difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ABO blood types carry different association risk factors for the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU.

METHODS: Cross-sectional weekly surveys were fielded over four weeks, during which western Pennsylvania was under stay-at-home orders. Respondents were divided into families of CWD (N = 233) or without CWD (N = 1582). Survey questions included measures of socio-economic status, and families of CWD answered questions regarding access to services pre and post-initiation of stay-at-home orders. Differences between families with and without CWD were analyzed using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among families of CWD that had used services previously, 76.6% of survey respondents stated that they had decreased access, with the greatest percentage experiencing loss among those previously utilizing early intervention (75.5%), outpatient therapies (69.1%), or school-based therapies (80.7%). Compared to families without CWD, families of CWD were more likely to report lower pre-COVID-19 annual incomes (p < 0.001), job or income loss related to COVID-19 (p < 0.001), and higher levels of perceived stress (p < 0.001).

A rising incidence of a rare occurring fungal infection earlier, called mucormycosis, has been reported in abundance across the globe since March 2021, especially in India just as the second wave of COVID-19 began, caused by the trifecta of hyperglycemia (new-onset or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes), oxygen therapy (invasive or noninvasive ventilation), and prolonged intake of steroids. Objective The present study aimed at assessing the prevalence of post-COVID mucormycosis in males of younger age group and spread of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). Methods A case-control study was performed over a period of 3 months among 60 male patients with confirmed diagnosis of mucormycosis. Individuals < 40 years old were included in the case group ( n = 30), while those > 40 years old were included as controls ( n = 30). Disease spread was assessed in three types of ROCM, that is, rhinomaxillary, rhino-orbital, and rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis. Results In the control group, the mean age was 48.47 years old, the mean HbA1c was 10.62 +/- 1.88%, with most of them suffering from rhino-orbital mucormycosis. In the case group, the mean age was 31.57 years old, with a mean HbA1c of 10.11 +/- 2.46%, and most patients had rhinomaxillary mucormycosis. The duration of steroid intake and mode of oxygen therapy were found to be significant in the severity of ROCM. Conclusion Rising cases of post-COVID mucormycosis have brought to light the fatal consequences of prolonged use of steroids and oxygen therapy towards the development and spread of ROCM among young and middle-aged males.", "CI": ["Fundacao Otorrinolaringologia.

This raises the question of the causes of the virus-induced immune immunosuppression. Searching for molecular link(s) between SARS-CoV-2 immunization and the decay of the adaptive immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 proteome was analyzed for molecular mimicry with human proteins related to immunodeficiency. The aim was to verify the possibility of cross-reactions capable of destroying the adaptive immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods Human immunodeficiency-related proteins were collected from UniProt database and analyzed for sharing of minimal immune determinants with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Results Molecular mimicry and consequent potential cross-reactivity exist between SARS-CoV-2 proteome and human immunoregulatory proteins such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), and variable diversity joining V(D)J recombination-activating gene (RAG). Conclusion The data (1) support molecular mimicry and the associated potential cross-reactivity as a mechanism that can underlie self-reactivity against proteins involved in B- and T-cells activation/development, and (2) suggest that the extent of the immunosuppression is dictated by the extent of the immune responses themselves. The higher the titer of the immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 immunization, the more severe can be the cross-reactions against the human immunodeficiency-related proteins, the more severe the immunosuppression. Hence, SARS-CoV-2-induced immunosuppression can be defined as a molecular mimicry syndrome. Clinically, the data imply that booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may have opposite results to those expected.", "CI": ["The Author(s).

To halt the spread of COVID-19, it is critical to identify the infection as soon as possible. Due to time constraints and the expertise of radiologists, manually diagnosing this infection from chest X-ray images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Artificial intelligence techniques have had a significant impact on medical image analysis and have also introduced several techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep learning and explainable AI have shown significant popularity among AL techniques for COVID-19 detection and classification. In this work, we propose a deep learning and explainable AI technique for the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. Initially, a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is proposed and applied to the original images that are later utilized for the training of two modified deep learning models. The deep transfer learning concept is selected for the training of pretrained modified models that are later employed for feature extraction. Features of both deep models are fused using improved canonical correlation analysis that is further optimized using a hybrid algorithm named Whale-Elephant Herding. Through this algorithm, the best features are selected and classified using an extreme learning machine (ELM). Moreover, the modified deep models are utilized for Grad-CAM visualization. The experimental process was conducted on three publicly available datasets and achieved accuracies of 99.1, 98.2, and 96.7%, respectively.

Now in its third year, the goals of the review are to highlight annual updates in the interdisciplinary world of clinical cardiac arrest research with a focus on clinically relevant and impactful clinical and population-level studies from 2020. Methods: A search of PubMed using keywords related to clinical research in cardiac arrest was conducted. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and sorted into 7 categories: Epidemiology & Public Health Initiatives; Prehospital Resuscitation, Technology & Care; In-Hospital Resuscitation & Post-Arrest Care; Prognostication & Outcomes; Pediatrics; Interdisciplinary Guidelines & Reviews; and a new section dedicated to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Screened manuscripts underwent standardized scoring of methodological quality and impact on the respective fields by reviewer teams lead by a subject matter expert editor. Articles scoring higher than 99 percentiles by category were selected for full critique. Systematic differences between editors' and reviewers' scores were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: A total of 3594 articles were identified on initial search; of these, 1026 were scored after screening for relevance and deduplication, and 51 underwent full critique. The leading category was Prehospital Resuscitation, Technology & Care representing 35% (18/51) of fully reviewed articles. Four COVID-19 related articles were included for formal review that was attributed to a relative lack of high-quality data concerning cardiac arrest and COVID-19 specifically by the end of the 2020 calendar year. No significant differences between editor and reviewer scoring were found among review articles (P = 0.697). Among original research articles, section editors scored a median 1 point (interquartile range, 0-3; P < 0.01) less than reviewers.

The aim of this research was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital food services, particularly on food waste and the completion of food waste audits. METHODS: A qualitative interview research design was used. Semi-structured interviews were completed and recorded via Zoom, focusing on the barriers and enablers towards the completion of hospital food waste audits. Twenty-one participants were interviewed from 12 hospitals. No questions were related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on hospital food services, however this issue frequently emerged during interviews. Data were coded following inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were generated from the interviews related to COVID-19 and hospital food services; impacts on practice, labour, change, technology and post-pandemic expectations. Participants reported COVID-19 negatively affected food service operations. Changes included increased food waste, contact restrictions, and labour shortages. Nonetheless, hospitals embraced the challenge and created new positions, trialled different food waste data collection methods, and utilised technology to support food service operations around COVID-19 restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact COVID-19 had on hospital food services, including their ability to audit food waste and increased food waste generation, the response from food services has demonstrated their adaptability to change. Sustainable healthcare, including the aggregate measuring and reduction of food waste in hospital food services, is an essential transition post-pandemic, and may be facilitated through the operational changes forced by COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase from the inception of the databases until 15th April 2021. Data regarding the sexual function, measured by female sexual function index (FSFI), of adult sexually active women were extracted from the eligible studies and compared between the before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcome was the frequency of intercourse during pandemic time. The random-effect model was used to pool the mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) value. RESULTS: Our search resulted in a sample of six eligible studies, which involved 1114 female participants. The total FSFI score among study participants during pandemic was 22.93 (95% CI: 19.26-26.59), which indicated a significant decrease in sexual function of women during pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic time (mean difference = -3.80, 95% CI: -6.48 to -1.12, p = 0.005, I(2) = 96%). We also conducted a meta-analysis of individual FSFI domains. During pandemic, women had problems with arousal (p < 0.0001), orgasm (p = 0.0008), satisfaction (p = 0.0009), and pain (p = 0.009). No significant difference in frequency of intercourse was observed between pre- and during pandemic (p = 0.80). Furthermore, no significant publication bias was present among included studies. CONCLUSION: Overall, there was a significant decrease in sexual function of sexually active adult women during COVID-19 pandemic. The most affected areas of sexual function were arousal, orgasm, pain, and satisfaction.

Host whole blood transcriptomics can offer unique insights into the biological processes underpinning infection and disease, as well as severity. We performed whole blood RNA Sequencing of individuals with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes. In this study, for the first time, we show how immunomodulatory treatments commonly administered to COVID-19 patients greatly alter the transcriptome.

The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines recommend that children undergoing hypospadias surgery should be between 6 and 18 months. In China, where many children have hypospadias, it remains unknown whether clinical characteristics, socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 were associated with delayed surgery in children with hypospadias. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed children with hypospadias who underwent primary surgery at the Department of Pediatric Urology in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between January 2010 and October 2021. Patients who had two-stage surgery or a second round of surgery due to complications were excluded to eliminate data duplication. The clinical characteristics and demographic information were collected. We defined delayed surgery as primary surgery performed after 18 months following the EAU Guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 4439 children diagnosed with hypospadias were included in the study. The median age (29.1 +/- 16.7 months) of surgery for hypospadias in our study was much higher than the recommended age reported in the EAU guidelines, and 76.6% of the children underwent surgery after the age of 18 months. Children without comorbidities including cryptorchidism (odds ratio [OR] = 1.562; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.199-2.034; p = 0.001), prostatic cyst (OR = 2.613; 95% CI 1.579-4.324; p < 0.001), penile hypoplasia (OR = 1.778; 95% CI 1.225-2.580; p = 0.002), inguinal hernia (OR = 2.070; 95% CI 1.394-3.075; p < 0.001), and penoscrotal transposition (OR = 4.125; 95% CI 1.250-13.619; p = 0.020) were more likely to receive delayed surgery. Living in a low economic area (OR = 1.731; 95% CI 1.068-2.806; p = 0.026) or not close to a main medical center (OR = 1.580; 95% CI 1.370-1.824; p < 0.001) was highly associated with delayed surgery. The proportion of children undergoing delayed surgery and the median age of surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly higher than those before the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.004 and < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most children with hypospadias received delayed surgery (surgical age > 18 months). Comorbidities, living in a low economic area, too far from a main medical center and the COVID-19 pandemic were highly associated with delayed surgery. It is vital to improve the public awareness of hypospadias and strengthen the re-education of primary community doctors to reduce delayed surgery.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

olfactory system have been proposed as one of the possible underlying causes of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19. We aimed to aggregate the results of the studies which reported imaging of the olfactory system of patients with COVID-19 versus controls. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify relevant literature reporting the structural imaging characteristics of the olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory cleft, olfactory sulcus (OS), or olfactory tract in COVID-19 patients. Hedge's g and weighted mean difference were used as a measure of effect size. Quality assessment, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, out of which seven studies with 183 cases with COVID-19 and 308 controls without COVID-19 were enrolled in the quantitative synthesis. No significant differences were detected in analyses of right OB volume and left OB volume. Likewise, right OS depth and left OS depth were also not significantly different in COVID-19 cases compared to non-COVID-19 controls. Also, we performed subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis to investigate the potential effect of confounding moderators. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review did not confirm alterations in structural imaging of the olfactory system, including OB volume and OS depth by Covid-19 which is consistent with the results of recent histopathological evaluations.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

However, during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the management of emergent surgeries changed to avoid contagion exposure among medical workers and poor postoperative outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old man presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed intraluminal membranes, an irregular or absent wall, and an abscess of the gallbladder, indicating acute gangrenous cholecystitis. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed to be indicated; however, a COVID-19 antigen test was positive despite no obvious pneumonia on chest computed tomography and no symptoms. After discussion among the multidisciplinary team, antibiotic therapy was started and percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) was planned for the following day because the patient's vital signs were stable and his abdominal pain was localized. Fortunately, the antibiotic therapy was very effective, and PTGBD was not needed. The cholecystitis improved and the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 10. One month later, laparoscopic delayed cholecystectomy was performed after confirming a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test result. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 in satisfactory condition. CONCLUSION: We have reported a case of acute gangrenous cholecystitis in a patient with asymptomatic COVID-19 disease.

The infection can be asymptomatic and cause mild symptoms, but it also can evolve into a severe disease and lead to death. It is difficult to predict which patients will develop severe disease. There are, in the literature, machine learning models capable of assisting diagnose and predicting outcomes for several diseases, but usually these models require laboratory tests and/or imaging. METHODS: We conducted a observational cohort study that evaluated vital signs and measurements from patients who were admitted to Hospital das Clinicas (Sao Paulo, Brazil) between March 2020 and October 2021 due to COVID-19. The data was then represented as univariate and multivariate time series, that were used to train and test machine learning models capable of predicting a patient's outcome. RESULTS: Time series-based machine learning models are capable of predicting a COVID-19 patient's outcome with up to 96% general accuracy and 81% accuracy considering only the first hospitalization day. The models can reach up to 99% sensitivity (discharge prediction) and up to 91% specificity (death prediction).

Even though healthcare workers provide psychological services, the mental health of the overall population often is cause for concern. Psychosocial stressors of the population play a critical role in impacting both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress and psychological disorder, during and after an infectious disease outbreak. The inability to plan, to anticipate future events, and to exert control, at least partially, over external variables inevitably generate stress and tension. Subsequently, this condition can generate more or less discomfort depending on the subjective evaluation of the individual, an evaluation which is influenced by the individual's stable personality traits. In fact, subjective experiences are never unique: stimuli endowed with the same stressful power do not necessarily cause these reactions in different individuals, while stressful conditions of varying degrees can induce the same response in different people. The aim of this research was to evaluate some aspects of mental health using answers related to this pandemic of a group young people, selected by chance.

The aim was to analyse the association between ABO blood group and risk of COVID-19 infection and complications in elderly patients, and to contrast this data with findings in the overall adult population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of the Navarre (Spain) population aged >/=60 years and a meta-analysis of published studies including participants of >/=60 years were carried out. RESULTS: In the Navarre elderly population, a higher risk of COVID-19 infection was identified in the A versus non-A and O group and lower risk in O versus non-O, with no significant association between hospitalization, intensive care unit admission or mortality and any of the blood groups, results that coincide with those of the overall Navarre adult population. The meta-analyses using studies that included participants of >/=60 years demonstrated a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality in A versus non-A and a lower mortality risk with B versus non-B. Similar mortality results were found in the meta-analyses of the overall adult population. CONCLUSION: There are no relevant differences between the overall adult population and population aged >/=60 years in the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity according to ABO blood groups, suggesting that age-related changes in ABO would be of limited clinical significance.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 International Society of Blood Transfusion."], "FAU": ["Leache, Leire", "Gutierrez-Valencia, Marta", "Enguita-German, Monica", "Librero, Julian", "Gorricho, Javier", "Jerico, Carlos", "Garcia-Erce, Jose Antonio"], "AU": ["Leache L", "Gutierrez-Valencia M", "Enguita-German M", "Librero J", "Gorricho J", "Jerico C", "Garcia-Erce JA"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2272-7086", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3229-6614", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2890-1252", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4859-9054", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3609-9922", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1049-4027", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7662-6286"], "AD": ["Unit of Innovation and Organization, Navarre Health Service, Pamplona, Spain.", "Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Unit of Innovation and Organization, Navarre Health Service, Pamplona, Spain.", "Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Unit of Methodology, Navarrabiomed, Pamplona, Spain.", "University Hospital of Navarra (HUN), Pamplona, Spain.", "Public University of Navarre (UPNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Red de Investigacion en Cronicidad, Atencion Primaria y Promocion de la Salud (RICAPPS), Madrid, Spain.", "Navarra Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Unit of Methodology, Navarrabiomed, Pamplona, Spain.", "University Hospital of Navarra (HUN), Pamplona, Spain.", "Public University of Navarre (UPNA), Pamplona, Spain.", "Red de Investigacion en Cronicidad, Atencion Primaria y Promocion de la Salud (RICAPPS), Madrid, Spain.", "Service of Evaluation and Dissemination of Results, Navarre Health Service, Pamplona, Spain.", "Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Sant Joan Despi-Moises Broggi, Consorci Sanitari Integral, Barcelona, Spain.", "Blood and Tissue Bank of Navarre, Navarre Health Service, Pamplona, Spain.", "Grupo Espanol de Rehabilitacion Multimodal (GERM), Aragon Health Sciences Institute (IACS), Zaragoza, Spain.", "PBM Group, Hospital La Paz Institute for Health Research (IdiPAZ), Madrid, Spain."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220717", "PL": "England", "TA": "Vox Sang", "JT": "Vox sanguinis", "JID": "0413606", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["ABO", "COVID-19", "blood groups", "cohort", "meta-analysis"], "EDAT": "2022/07/18 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/18 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/17 22:33"], "PHST": ["2022/05/24 00:00 [revised]", "2022/03/15 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/12 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/17 22:33 [entrez]", "2022/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/18 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1111/vox.13334 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Vox Sang. 2022 Jul 17. doi: 10.1111/vox.13334."}, {"PMID": "35843871", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220717", "IS": "1521-1878 (Electronic) 0265-9247 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 17", "TI": "Molecular dynamics studies reveal structural and functional features of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.", "PG": "e2200060", "LID": "10.1002/bies.202200060 [doi]", "AB": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic the world experience since 2019.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental feasibility trial of \"RCT\" type carried out in a single-center, between November 2019 and March 2020, following adult patients treated by thoracic radiotherapy. In addition to the information usually given, the experimental group benefited from an intervention consisting in the visualization of their own medical images using the open-source software \"Stone of Orthanc\". RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were recruited with a refusal rate of 8.16% (4/49). 20 patients were withdrawn from the study for health reasons (COVID), 10 for medical reasons. All the remaining 15 participants completed the process. Although not significant, the experimental group showed a median gain in the perception of knowledge compared to the control group (+ 1.9 (1.6 - 2.2)) vs (+ 1.4 (1.4 - 1.8)), as well as a decrease in scores related to anxiety (- 3.0 (-4.5 - (-2.0)) vs - 1.0 (-5.0 - 0.0)) and emotional distress ((- 5.0 (- 7.5 - (- 3.5)) vs (- 2.0 (- 5.0 - (- 1.0)) A significant reduction (p=0.043) is observed for the depression score ((- 2.0 (-3.0 - (-1.5)) vs (0.0 (0.0 - 0.0)).

The present study evaluates the occurrence of subacute thyroiditis in temporal connection with SARS-Cov2 vaccinations described in the literature last year and confirmed by our clinical routine. Methods. Systematic literature search in Medline for studies reporting diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis in temporal connection with vaccinations against Covid 19. Results. The literature search yielded 24 relevant references out of which 22 were \"case reports\" and two \"Letters to the Editor\" and encompassed 37 patient cases, in total. They had received a SARS-Cov2 vaccination shortly before the diagnosis (median interval to vaccination six days). In none of these cases, infection of the upper respiratory tract had previously been identified as a classic trigger of the disease. Newly occurring hyperthyroidism and increased laboratory signs of inflammation were described in 78% and 74% of cases, respectively. Atypical clinical pictures (asymptomatic, euthyroid, no inflammation marks) have been observed in both the literature and our patients suspected of thyroid cancer referred to surgery. Conclusions. In times of pandemics and the resulting vaccination, new rapidly occurring sonographic changes in the thyroid gland should be revaluated after 2-3 weeks, or recommended to undergo a fine-needle biopsy, in order to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Costanza Chiapponi et al., published by Sciendo."], "FAU": ["Chiapponi, Costanza", "Faust, Michael", "Schmidt, Matthias", "Thomas, Michael", "Schultheis, Anne Maria", "Akgul, Baki", "Alakus, Hakan"], "AU": ["Chiapponi C", "Faust M", "Schmidt M", "Thomas M", "Schultheis AM", "Akgul B", "Alakus H"], "AD": ["Department of General, Visceral, Cancer and Transplant Surgery, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Policlinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Prevention Medicine, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Department for Nuclear Medicine, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Department of General, Visceral, Cancer and Transplant Surgery, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Institute for Pathology, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Institute for Virology, University of Cologne, Medical Faculty and University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.", "Department of General, Visceral, Cancer and Transplant Surgery, University Clinic of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Endocr Regul", "JT": "Endocrine regulations", "JID": "9112018", "RN": ["0 (RNA, Viral)"], "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/prevention & control", "Humans", "RNA, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "*Thyroiditis, Subacute/diagnosis/etiology/pathology", "Vaccination/adverse effects"], "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["SARS-Cov2", "inflammation", "subacute thyroiditis", "vaccinations"], "EDAT": "2022/07/18 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/20 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/17 21:22"], "PHST": ["2022/07/17 21:22 [entrez]", "2022/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/20 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["enr-2022-0024 [pii]", "10.2478/enr-2022-0024 [doi]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "Endocr Regul. 2022 Jul 13;56(3):227-231. doi: 10.2478/enr-2022-0024."}, {"PMID": "35843590", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220717", "IS": "1872-9649 (Electronic) 1568-1637 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 14", "TI": "SARS-CoV-2 and the Central Nervous System: Emerging Insights into Hemorrhage-Associated Neurological Consequences and Therapeutic Considerations.", "PG": "101687", "LID": "S1568-1637(22)00129-5 [pii] 10.1016/j.arr.2022.101687 [doi]", "AB": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to impact our lives by causing widespread illness and death and poses a threat due to the possibility of emerging strains. SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering vital organs of the body, including the brain. Studies have shown systemic inflammation, cellular senescence, and viral toxicity-mediated multi-organ failure occur during infectious periods. However, prognostic investigations suggest that both acute and long-term neurological complications, including predisposition to irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, can be a serious concern for COVID-19 survivors, especially the elderly population. As emerging studies reveal sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different parts of the brain, potential causes of chronic lesions including cerebral and deep-brain microbleeds and the likelihood of developing stroke-like pathologies increases, with critical long-term consequences, particularly for individuals with neuropathological and/or age-associated comorbid conditions. Our recent studies linking the blood degradation products to genome instability, leading to cellular senescence and ferroptosis, raise the possibility of similar neurovascular events as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we discuss the neuropathological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID survivors, focusing on possible hemorrhagic damage in brain cells, its association to aging, and the future directions in developing mechanism-guided therapeutic strategies.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

We reviewed studies exploring use of wearables on neurosurgical patients and analyzed wearables' scientific production trends. METHODS: The review encompassed PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Bibliometric analysis was performed using citation data of the included studies through Elsevier's Scopus database. Linear regression was utilized to understand scientific production trends. All analyses were performed on R 4.1.2. RESULTS: We identified 979 studies. After screening, 49 studies were included. Most studies evaluated wearable technology use for patients with spinal pathology (n=31). The studies were published in a 24-year period (1998-2021). Forty-seven studies involved wearable device-use relevant to telemedicine. Bibliometric analysis revealed a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3%, adjusted for inflation, in annual scientific production from 1998 to 2021 (coefficient=1.3; 95% C.I. = [0.7, 1.9], p<0.01). Scientific production steadily increased in 2014 (n=1) and peaked from 2019 (n=8) to 2021 (n=13) in correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic. Publications spanned 34 journals, averaged 24.4 citations per article, 3.0 citations per year per article, and 8.3 authors per article. CONCLUSION: Wearables can provide clinicians with objective measurements to determine patient function and quality of life. The rise in articles related to wearables in neurosurgery demonstrates the increased adoption of wearable devices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wearable devices appear to be a key component in this era of telemedicine and their positive utility and practicality are increasingly being realized in neurosurgery.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We report this using facemask sampling (FMS) and assessed the relationship between emitted RNA VL and household transmission. METHODS: Between December 2020 and February 2021, we recruited participants within 24 hours of a positive RT-qPCR on upper respiratory tract sampling (URTS) (day 0). Participants gave FMS (for 1 hour) and URTS (self-taken) on 7 occasions up to day 21. Samples were analysed by RT-qPCR (from sampling matrix strips within the mask) and symptom diaries recorded. Household transmission was assessed through reporting of positive URTS RT-qPCR in household contacts. RESULTS: Analysis of 203 FMS and 190 URTS from 34 participants showed that RNA VL peaked in the first five days following sampling. Concomitant URTS, FMS RNA VL and symptom scores however were poorly correlated, but a higher severity of reported symptoms was associated with FMS positivity up to day 5. Of 28 participants who had household contacts, 12 (43%) reported transmission. Frequency of household transmission was associated with the highest (peak) FMS RNA VL obtained (negative copies/strip: 0% household transmission; 1-1000 copies/strip: 20%; 1001 - 10,000 copies/strip: 57%; >10,000 copies/strip: 75%; p=0.048; age adjusted odds ratio of transmission per log increase in copies/strip: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.20-20.55, p=0.02) but this was not observed with peak URTS RNA VL. CONCLUSIONS: Exhaled RNA VL measured by FMS is highest in early infection, can be positive in symptomatic patients with concomitantly negative URTS and is strongly associated with household transmission.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

METHODS: This cohort study examined the adverse events profiles of people vaccinated with BNT162b2 in our institute between late 2020 and May 2021. Adverse events, age, and gender were reported using an electronic questionnaire, and their SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were retrieved from the hospital database. RESULTS: Between 20 December 2020 and 31 May 2021, the adverse events questionnaire was completed by 9700 individuals who received the first vaccine dose and 8321 who received the second dose. After the first and second doses, average antibody levels were 62.34 AU/ml (mean 4-373) and 188.19 AU/ml (mean 20-392), respectively. All adverse events, except local pain, were more common after the second vaccine dose. Multivariate analysis showed that after the first vaccine dose, female sex and younger age (but not IgG titres) were associated with a higher probability of adverse events (OR 2.377, 95% CI 1.607-3.515, p=.000; OR .959, 95% CI .944-.977, p</=.000; OR 1.002, 95% CI .995-1.008, p</=.601; respectively); however, all three parameters were associated with the incidence of adverse events following the second dose (OR 2.332, 95% CI 1.636-3.322, p=.000; OR .984, 95% CI .970-.999, p</=.039; OR 1.004, 95% CI 1.001-1.007, p</=.022; respectively).

However, the practicality of UV light is limited by the carcinogenic potential of mercury vapor-based UV lamps. Recent advances in the development of krypton chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamps hold promise, as these emit a shorter peak wavelength (222 nm), which is highly absorbed by the skin's stratum corneum and can filter out higher wavelengths. In this sense, UV 222 nm irradiation for the inactivation of virus particles in the air and surfaces is a potentially safer option as a germicidal technology. However, these same physical properties make it harder to reach microbes present in complex solutions, such as saliva, a critical source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We provide the first evaluation for using a commercial filtered KrCl excimer light source to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva spread on a surface. A conventional germicidal lamp (UV 254 nm) was also evaluated under the same condition. Using plaque-forming units (PFU) and Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) per milliliter we found that 99.99% viral clearance (LD99.99) was obtained with 106.3 mJ/cm(2) of UV 222 nm for virus in DMEM and 2417 mJ/cm(2) for virus in saliva. Additionally, our results showed that the UV 254 nm had a greater capacity to inactivate the virus in both vehicles. Effective (after discounting light absorption) LD99.99 of UV 222 nm on the virus in saliva was approximately 30 times higher than the value obtained with virus in saline solution (PBS), we speculated that saliva might be protecting the virus from surface irradiation in ways other than just by intensity attenuation of UV 222 nm. Due to differences between UV 222/254 nm capacities to interact and be absorbed by molecules in complex solutions, a higher dose of 222 nm will be necessary to reduce viral load in surfaces with contaminated saliva.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: An online survey of 17 questions was sent via web link to orthopedic surgery residents throughout Spain between February 10, 2021 and February 28, 2021. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care and training activities of residents were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 307 orthopedic surgery residents from all over Spain responded to the online survey. A total of 77.2% of the respondents had to suspend their rotations. Of these, 67.5% would like to resume the rotations they missed during the pandemic. A total of 69.7% of scheduled surgeries were suspended. Surgical activity was completely stopped for an average of 8 weeks. 66.8% of the residents consider that their surgical training has been affected and this will have repercussions on their future work. 49.5% considered the online training offered to be insufficient. Of the total number of respondents, 52.1% considered that the impact of the pandemic situation on their training situation was bad or very bad.

We estimated effectiveness of these vaccines against severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals aged >/=45 years. METHODS: We did a multi-centric, hospital-based, case-control study between May and July 2021. Cases were severe COVID-19 patients and controls were COVID-19 negative individuals from 11 hospitals. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated for full (2 doses >/=14days) and partial (1 dose >/=21 days) vaccination; duration between two vaccine doses and against the Delta variant. We used a random effects logistic regression model to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% CI after adjusting for relevant known confounders. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,143 cases and 2,541 controls. The VE of full vaccination was 85% (95% CI: 79%-89%) with AZD1222/Covishield and 71% (95% CI: 57%-81%) with BBV152/Covaxin. The VE was highest for an interval of 6-8 weeks between two doses of AZD1222/Covishield (94%, 95% CI: 86%-97%) and BBV152/Covaxin (93%, 95% CI: 34%-99%). The VE estimates were similar against the Delta strain and sub-lineages. CONCLUSION: BBV152/Covaxin and AZD1222/Covishield were effective against severe COVID-19 among the Indian population during the period of dominance of highly transmissible Delta variant in second wave of pandemic.

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a programme of actions promoting responsible antimicrobial use, and is essential for limiting AMR. Nurses have an important role to play in this context. AIM: This study investigated the determinants of nurse AMS behaviours and the impact of past training. METHOD: A cross-sectional multi-country survey design with mixed methods was employed. Participants were 262 nurses (223 female; mean age = 44.45; SD = 10.77 years) from ten nationalities, with individual survey links sent via professional networks in 5 countries, alongside Twitter. Nine AMS behaviours and 14 behavioural determinants were quantitatively assessed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and mapped to the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour) model. Analysis identified differences between nurses with and without AMS training. The influence of COVID-19 on AMS behaviour was qualitatively investigated using free text data. FINDINGS: Nurses performed all nine AMS behaviours, which were significantly higher (t(238) = -4.14, p < .001), by those who had training (M = 53.15; SD = 7.40) compared to those who had not (M = 48.30; SD = 10.75). Those with AMS training scored significantly higher in all of the TDF domains. The TDF was able to explain 27% of the variance in behaviour, with 'Skills' and 'Behavioural Regulation' (e.g. ability to self-monitor and plan), shown to be the most predictive of AMS actions. Both of these domains are situated in the Capability construct of COM-B, which can be enhanced with the intervention strategies of education and training. An increase in AMS behaviours was reported since COVID-19, regardless of previous training. Six core themes were linked to AMS: 1) Infection prevention and control, 2) Antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance, 3) The diagnosis of infection and the use of antibiotics, 4) Antimicrobial prescribing practice, 5) Person-centred care, and 6) Interprofessional collaborative practice. CONCLUSION: This research, has identified the significant benefit of nurse training on AMS behaviour, and its determinants. Those who had training, scored higher in all TDF determinants of behaviour, compared to those who had had no training, resulting in higher Capability, Opportunity and Motivation to perform AMS behaviours. AMS education and training should be offered to nurses to enhance these factors. Future research should consider the optimal level of training to optimise AMS behaviour, with a focus on developing skills and behavioural regulation.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Healthcare Infection Society.

A significant proportion of the morbidity and mortality in influenza is attributed to the co-morbidities and complications induced by the disease, involving the vital organs and physiological functions. In this context, traditional medicines offer effective protective, palliative, and therapeutic benefits, as observed in several studies on various types of influenza, including COVID-19. The Unani herbal decoction comprising of 'Unnab (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. fruit), Sapistan (Cordia dichotoma G. Forst. fruit), and Behidana (Cydonia oblonga Mill. seed) was originally prescribed by Hakim Ajmal Khan (1868-1927 AD) for various respiratory ailments as a bronchodilator, anti-inflammatory, and for clearing the respiratory tract. During COVID-19, the decoction was prescribed by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH), Government of India, for mild patients in home isolation, and also as a self-care drink for healthy people. Preliminary studies are of the view that the decoction could reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevent severe disease in the population where it was administered. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We intend to review the pharmacological activity of the Unani decoction ingredients, i.e., Z. jujuba, C. dichotoma, and C. oblonga, in context with respiratory viral infections and their co-morbidities, to develop an understanding of its action mechanism. METHOD: ology: We reviewed Unani classical textbooks for information on the therapeutic activity of the decoction ingredients. Scientific studies published in English from the year 2000 onwards on leading scientific websites (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Springer) were searched for information regarding the efficacy of the drugs in influenza and its common complications. Non-English language articles, or those published prior to 2000, and those which included plant parts other than those traditionally included in the decoction were excluded. OBSERVATIONS: A wide range of therapeutic and palliative effects have been observed in the three herbs included in the Unani decoction, including anti-viral, anti-bacterial, immuno-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, hepato-, and nephroprotective, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-tussive, broncho-dilatory, and regulation of gut microbiota. Together, these effects can help to mitigate and prevent most of the complications caused as a result of respiratory viral infections. CONCLUSION: The combined effects of ingredients in this Unani herbal decoction can potentially help to mitigate most of the pathological changes and complications caused by influenza viruses. With further clinical research, the decoction may be potentially utilized as a prophylactic and therapeutic against viral influenza.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

The results of molecular docking determined 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloyl glucose (PG) as the most effective compound of Pistaciasp, which also confirmed its excellent binding affinities and stable interactions with helicase (-10.76kcal/mol), RdRp (-10.19kcal/mol), E protein (-9.51kcal/mol), and 3CLpro (-9.47kcal/mol). Furthermore, MD simulation was conducted to investigate the stability of all complexes throughout a 100 ns. In contrast to PLpro and NSP15, the analyses of Lennard-Jones potential, RMSDas, PCA, and SASA verified the ability of PG in forming stable and adequate interactions with RdRp, helicase, 3CLpro, and E protein due to standing as an effective inhibitor among the six targets, these data proposed the capability of PG, the most important compound of Pistaciasp., in inducing antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant impacts on RdRp, helicase, 3CLpro, and E protein.

This allocation problem is highly complex and nonlinear. Decision makers need a practical, accurate, and interpretable method to guide vaccine allocation. In this paper we develop simple analytical conditions that can guide the allocation of vaccines over time. We consider four objectives: minimize new infections, minimize deaths, minimize life years lost, or minimize quality-adjusted life years lost due to death. We consider an SIR model with interacting population groups. We approximate the model using Taylor series expansions, and develop simple analytical conditions characterizing the optimal solution to the resulting problem for a single time period. We develop a solution approach in which we allocate vaccines using the analytical conditions in each time period based on the state of the epidemic at the start of the time period. We illustrate our method with an example of COVID-19 vaccination, calibrated to epidemic data from New York State. Using numerical simulations, we show that our method achieves near-optimal results over a wide range of vaccination scenarios. Our method provides a practical, intuitive, and accurate tool for decision makers as they allocate limited vaccines over time, and highlights the need for more interpretable models over complicated black box models to aid in decision making.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report the allosteric communication pathways in the main protease dimer by using two novel fully atomistic graph-theoretical methods: Bond-to-bond propensity, which has been previously successful in identifying allosteric sites in extensive benchmark data sets without a priori knowledge, and Markov transient analysis, which has previously aided in finding novel drug targets in catalytic protein families.

Out of the total number of nosocomial infections diagnosed all around the world, the majority of the cases (around 70%) are found to be due to the medical device or assistance utilized while treating the patient. Combating these diseases is vital as they cause a nuisance to the patients and medical practitioners. Coatings of graphene and its derivatives hold the key to the formation of special surfaces that can rupture microbial cells using their sharp edges, ultimately leading to nuclear and cellular fragmentation. Their incorporation as a whole or as a part in the hospital apparel and the medical device has aided medical practitioners to combat many nosocomial diseases. Graphene is found to be highly virulent with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against nosocomial strains and biofilm formation. Their alternate mode of action like trapping and charge transfer has also been discussed well in the present review. The various combinational forms of graphene with its conjugates as a suitable agent to combat nosocomial infections and a potential coating for newer challenges like COVID-19 infections has also been assessed in the current study. Efficiency of graphene sheets has been found to be around 89% with a reaction time as less as 3 hours. Polymers with graphene seem to have a higher potency against biofilm formation. When combined with graphene oxide, silver nanoparticles provide 99% activity against nosocomial pathogens. In conclusion, this review would be a guiding light for scientists working with graphene-based coatings to unfold the potentials of this marvelous commodity to tackle the present and future pandemics to come.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year. METHODS: For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol. FINDINGS: The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0.603 (0.400-1.00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0.002 (0-0) and 1.75 (0.698-4.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0.114 (0-0.403) to 1.87 (0.500-3.30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0.193 (0-0.900) and 6.94 (3.40-8.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59.1% (54.3-65.4) were aged 15-39 years and 76.9% (73.0-81.3) were male. INTERPRETATION: There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol.

Cerebral venous thrombosis(CVT) often precedes or coincides with bDAVFs and is considered a risk factor for these vascular malformations. Recently, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia causing CVTs has been associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Concurrently with the start of massive vaccination in our region, we have observed a fivefold increase in the average incidence of bDAVFs. Our objective is to raise awareness of the potential involvement of COVID-19 vaccines in the pathogenesis of bDAVF. METHODS: A retrospective review of demographic, clinical, radiological, COVID-19 infection and vaccination data of patients diagnosed with bDAVFs between 2011 and 2021 was conducted. Patients were divided into two cohorts according to their belonging to pre- or post-COVID-19 vaccination times. Cohorts were compared for bDAVFs incidences and demographic and clinical features. RESULTS: Twenty-one bDAVFs were diagnosed between 2011 and 2021, 7 of which in 2021. The mean age was 57.7 years, and 62 % were males. All cases except one were treated; of them, 85 % exclusively managed with surgery. All treated cases were successfully occluded. The incidence in 2021 was significantly higher than that in the prevaccination period (1.72 vs 0.35/100,000/year;p = 0.036; 95 %Confidence Interval=0.09-2.66). Cohorts were not different in age, sex, hemorrhagic presentation, dural sinus thrombosis or presence of prothrombotic or cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: The significant increase in the incidence of bDAVF following general vaccination policies against COVID-19 observed in our region suggests a potential correlation between these two facts. Our findings need confirmation from larger cohorts and further pathogenic research.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Low serum lipid levels during hospital admission are associated with COVID-19 severity. However, the effect of antecedent serum lipid levels on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk has not been explored. METHODS: From our retrospective cohort from the Arkansas Clinical Data-Repository, we used log-binomial regression to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the trajectories of lipid levels during the 2 years antecedent to COVID-19 testing, identified using group-based-trajectory modelling. We used mixed-effects linear regression to assess the serum lipid level trends followed up to the time of, and 2-months following COVID-19 testing. FINDINGS: Among the 11001 individuals with a median age of 59 years (IQR 46-70), 1340 (12.2%) tested positive for COVID-19. The highest trajectory for antecedent serum HDL-C was associated with the lowest SARS-CoV-2 infection risk (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.86). Antecedent serum LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. In COVID-19 patients, serum HDL-C (-7.7, 95%CI -9.8 to -5.5 mg/dL), and LDL-C (-6.29, 95%CI -12.2 to -0.37 mg/dL), but not TG levels, decreased transiently at the time of testing. INTERPRETATION: Higher antecedent serum HDL-C, but not LDL-C, TC, or TG, levels were associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.

This study aims to describe CCOT activation by patients with HM before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, assess amny association with worse outcomes, and examine the psychological impact on the CCOT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, mixed-methods analysis was performed in HM patients reviewed by the CCOT over a two-year period, 01 July 2019 to 31 May 2021. RESULTS: The CCOT increased in size during the surge period and reviewed 238 HM patients, less than in the pre- and post-surge periods. ICU admission in the baseline, surge and the non-surge periods were 41.7%, 10.4% and 47.9% respectively. ICU mortality was 22.5%, 0% and 21.7% for the same times. Time to review was significantly decreased (p = 0.012). Semi-structured interviews revealed four themes of psychological distress: 1) time-critical work; 2) non-evidence based therapies; 3) feelings of guilt; 4) increased decision-making responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in total hospital referrals, the number of patients with HM that were reviewed during the surge periods decreased, as did their ICU admission rate and mortality. The quality of care provided was not impaired, as reflected by the number of patients receiving bedside reviews and the shorter-than-pre-pandemic response time.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to investigate the feasibility and representativeness of mobile phone-based advertisement during a preliminary study about COVID-19 vaccine hesitation in Brazil. Moreover, we evaluate whether the older population can be reached through mobile phone-based platforms of the survey. METHODS: We conducted a study in December 2021 based on a preliminary survey about the COVID-19 vaccine hesitation in Assis, Brazil, Sao Paulo state. From a list of the adult population hesitant about the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, we sent a mobile phone-based advertisement inviting the participants to answer the survey for one week. The respondent's data were collected in a Google form platform. The comparison between the target population and the respondents was made using the Chi-squared test and the Welch's test, using a P-value of 0.05 as significative. RESULTS: The response rate was 9.99% after one week. The mean age of the respondent group was 33.97 (SD 14.99) and 35.05 (SD 14.19) of the population, with a P-value of 0.192 and a Cohen's d coefficient of 0.0754, corresponding to a small effect size between groups. We demonstrate that the mobile phone-based survey is a feasible and representative strategy during the pandemics in Brazil. Moreover, the older population respondent was representative. CONCLUSION: We achieved a representative sample of respondents using the mobile phone-based survey in Brazil. Furthermore, it was representative of all sociodemographic and health characteristics assessed.

The drug is used for management of the human immunovirus and is currently part of an oral antiviral drug combination (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) for the early treatment of SARS-2 Covid-19 positive patients aged 12 years and over who have recognised comorbidities. The CYP 3A enzyme system is responsible for clearance of numerous drugs used in anesthesia (e.g., alfentanil, fentanyl, methadone, rocuronium, bupivacaine, midazolam, ketamine). Ritonavir will have an impact on drug clearances that are dependent on ritonavir concentration, anesthesia drug intrinsic hepatic clearance, metabolic pathways, concentration-response relationship and route of administration. Drugs with a steep concentration-response relationship (ketamine, midazolam, rocuronium) are mostly affected because small changes in concentration have major changes in effect response. An increase in midazolam concentration is observed after oral administration because CYP 3A in the gastrointestinal wall is inhibited, causing a large increase in relative bioavailability. Fentanyl infusion may be associated with a modest increase in plasma concentration and effect, but the large between subject variability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concentration changes suggests it will have little impact on an individual patient, especially when used with adverse effect monitoring. It has been proposed that drugs that have no or only a small metabolic pathway involving the CYP 3A enzyme be used during anesthesia e.g., propofol, atracurium, remifentanil and the volatile agents. That anesthesia approach denies children of drugs with considerable value. It is better that the inhibitory changes in clearance of these drugs are understood so that rational drug choices can be made to tailor drug use to the individual patient. Altered drug dose, anticipation of duration of effect, timing of administration, use of reversal agents and perioperative monitoring would better behove children undergoing anesthesia.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

Since COVID-19 can cause damage to this system, long-term sequelae might alter control of postural stability. This study aimed to evaluate the postural balance of patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) who were not hospitalized and to evaluate the correlations of changes in postural balance with general fatigue, muscle strength, and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 40 patients with PCS and 40 controls underwent balance assessment through the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Tinetti Balance Scale (TBS). They were evaluated for general fatigue by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale, handgrip strength (HGS), and quality of life (QoL) by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). RESULTS: When compared to controls, patients with PCS had lower BBS and TBS scores (p = 0.001 for both). The FACIT-F score was lower in PCS patients (p = 0.0001). HGS was slightly lower in the PCS patients, but not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Regarding QoL, PCS patients showed worse evaluations in five dimensions of the SF-36 (physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and mental health). Both the BBS and TBS scores had statistically significant positive correlations with the FACIT-F score, HGS, and two SF-36 dimensions (physical role limitations and emotional role limitations). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PCS show worse postural balance than controls, which is associated with general fatigue, lower HGS, and poor QoL.

Thus, it is important to explore the frailty trajectories during COVID-19 pandemic and understand how COVID-19 directly and indirectly impacts on frailty condition. METHODS: We enrolled 217 community-dwelling older adults with available information on frailty condition as assessed by multidimensional frailty model both at baseline and at one-year follow-up using Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) tools. Pre-frail/frail subjects were identified at baseline as those with MPI score > 0.33 (MPI grade 2-3). Frailty worsening was defined by MPI difference between 12 months follow-up and baseline >/= 0.1. Multivariable logistic regression was modeled to identify predictors of worsening of frailty condition. RESULTS: Frailer subjects at baseline (MPI grade 2-3= 48.4%) were older, more frequently female and had higher rates of hospitalization and Sars-CoV-2 infection compared to robust ones (MPI grade 1). Having MPI grade 2-3 at baseline was associated with higher risk of further worsening of frailty condition (adjusted odd ratio (aOR): 13.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.01 to 46.09), independently by age, gender and Sars-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, frail subjects without COVID-19 (aOR: 14.84, 95% CI: 4.26 to 51.74) as well as those with COVID-19 (aOR: 12.77, 95% CI: 2.66 to 61.40, p= 0.001 ) had significantly higher risk of worsening of frailty condition.

vaccine in patients with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)-treated chronic immune neuropathies. METHODS: Forty-six samples of different brands or lots of IVIg or subcutaneous IgG (SCIg) were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG using ELISA and chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). Blood sera from 16 patients with immune neuropathies were prospectively analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgG, and IgM before and one week after IVIg infusion subsequent to consecutive COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses and after 12 weeks. These were compared to 42 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Twenty-four (52%) therapeutic immunoglobulin samples contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. All patients with immune neuropathies (mean age 65 +/- 16 years, 25 % female) were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG after COVID-19 vaccination. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA titers significantly decreased 12-14 weeks after vaccination (p=0.02), IgG titers remained stable (p=0.2). IVIg did not significantly reduce intra-individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG serum titers in immune neuropathies (p=0.69). IVIg-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG did not alter serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG decrease after IVIg administration (p=0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that IVIg does not impair the antibody response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in a short-term observation, when administered a minimum of two weeks after each vaccine dose. The infusion of current IVIg preparations that contain anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG does not significantly alter serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

Numerous studies have been conducted on SARS-CoV2 virus structure and pathogenesis to find reliable treatments and vaccines. The present study aimed to evaluate the immune-phenotype and IFN-I signaling pathways of COVID-19 patients with mild and severe conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 COVID-19 patients (50 with mild and 50 with severe conditions) were enrolled in this study. The frequency of CD4 + T, CD8 + T, Th17, Treg, and B lymphocytes beside NK cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. IFN-I downstream signaling molecules, including JAK-1, TYK-2, STAT-1, and STAT-2, and Interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 expressions at RNA and protein status were investigated using real-time PCR and western blotting techniques, respectively. Immune levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, IL-2R, IL-10, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta) and the existence of anti-IFN-alpha autoantibodies were evaluated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Immune-phenotyping results showed a significant decrease in the absolute count of NK cells, CD4 + T, CD8 + T, and B lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients. The frequency of Th17 and Treg cells showed a remarkable increase and decrease, respectively. All signaling molecules of the IFN-I downstream pathway and IRFs (i.e., JAK-1, TYK-2, STAT-1, STAT-2, IRF-3, and IRF-7) showed very reduced expression levels in COVID-19 patients with the severe condition compared to healthy individuals at both RNA and protein levels. Of 50 patients with severe conditions, 14 had anti-IFN-alpha autoantibodies in sera. Meanwhile, this result was 2 and 0 for patients with mild symptoms and healthy controls, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a positive association of the existence of anti-IFN-alpha autoantibodies and immune cells dysregulation with the severity of illness in COVID-19 patients. However, comprehensive studies are necessary to find out more about this context. Video abstract.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Poor MH may lead to absence from school and work, and adverse health outcomes. However, reviews suggest a lack of rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of MH interventions on health and education outcomes. The objective of this paper is to describe the methods used in a cluster-randomised controlled trial to estimate the effect of a multi-component intervention to improve MH and school attendance in The Gambia. METHODS: The design ensured half the schools (25) were randomised to receive the intervention which comprised of the following components: (i) Peer education camps and menstrual hygiene laboratories in schools, (ii) Mother's outreach sessions, (iii) Community meetings, and (iv) minor improvements of school Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities and maintenance. The intervention was run over a three-month period, and the evaluation was conducted at least three months after the last intervention activity was completed in the school or community. The other 25 schools acted as controls. Of these 25 control schools one Arabic school dropped out due to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of girls missing at least one day of school during their last period. Secondary outcomes included: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) symptoms, biochemical markers of UTI in urine, Reproductive Tract Infection symptoms, self-reported menstruation related wellbeing, social support and knowledge, perceptions and practices towards menstruation and MH in target school girls. In addition, a process evaluation using observations, routine monitoring data, survey data and interviews was undertaken to assess dose and reach (quantitative data) and assess acceptability, fidelity, context and possible mechanisms of impact (qualitative data). Cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention package will also be assessed. CONCLUSION: Results will add to scarce resources available on effectiveness of MH interventions on school attendance. A positive result may encourage policy makers to increase their commitment to improve operation and maintenance of school WASH facilities and include more information on menstruation into the curriculum and help in the reporting and management of infections related to adolescent menstruation.

Meanwhile, many COVID-19 survivors have residual postinfection clinical manifestations. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been shown to be effective in the early stages of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate long-term safety and efficacy of treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 patients who had received hUC-MSCs therapy. METHODS: Twenty-five discharged patients who had severe COVID-19 (including the standard treatment group and the standard treatment plus hUC-MSCs group) were enrolled in a 1-year follow-up. The assessment considered adverse effects (including effects on liver and kidney function, coagulation, ECG, tumor marker, and so on), pulmonary function, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), postinfection sequelae and serum concentration of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), malondialdehyde (MDA), H2S, carnitine, and N-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-6 LC-PUFAs). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary ventilation function had significantly improved at the 1-year follow-up in both the hUC-MSCs group and the control group compared with the 3-month follow-up (P < 0.01). Fatigue (60% [15/25]) remained the most common symptom at the 1-year follow-up. The rate of fatigue relief was significantly reduced in the hUC-MSCs group (25% [2/8]) compared to the control group (76.5% [13/17]) (P = 0.028). The level of KL-6 was significantly lower in the hUC-MSCs group (2585.5 +/- 186.5 U/ml) than in the control group (3120.7 +/- 158.3 U/ml) (P < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the hUC-MSCs group had a lower level of MDA (9.27 +/- 0.54 vs. 9.91 +/- 0.72 nmol/ml, P = 0.036). No obvious adverse effects were observed in the hUC-MSCs treatment group at 1 year after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous transplantation of hUC-MSCs was a safe approach in the long term in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, hUC-MSCs had a positive effect on postinfection sequelae in COVID-19 survivors.

Yet, data on prevalence, predictors and relevance for outcome of neurological manifestations in patients requiring intensive care are scarce. We aimed to characterize prevalence, risk factors and impact on outcome of neurologic manifestations in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In the prospective, multicenter, observational registry study PANDEMIC (Pooled Analysis of Neurologic DisordErs Manifesting in Intensive care of COVID-19), we enrolled COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations admitted to 19 German intensive care units (ICU) between April 2020 and September 2021. We performed descriptive and explorative statistical analyses. Multivariable models were used to investigate factors associated with disorder categories and their underlying diagnoses as well as to identify predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Of the 392 patients included in the analysis, 70.7% (277/392) were male and the mean age was 65.3 (SD +/- 3.1) years. During the study period, a total of 2681 patients with COVID-19 were treated at the ICUs of 15 participating centers. New neurologic disorders were identified in 350 patients, reported by these centers, suggesting a prevalence of COVID-19-associated neurologic disorders of 12.7% among COVID-19 ICU patients. Encephalopathy (46.2%; 181/392), cerebrovascular (41.0%; 161/392) and neuromuscular disorders (20.4%; 80/392) were the most frequent categories identified. Out of 35 cerebrospinal fluid analyses with reverse transcriptase PCR for SARS-COV-2, only 3 were positive. In-hospital mortality was 36.0% (140/389), and functional outcome (mRS 3 to 5) of surviving patients was poor at hospital discharge in 70.9% (161/227). Intracerebral hemorrhage (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.5-14.9, p < 0.001) and acute ischemic stroke (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.9-8.2, p < 0.001) were the strongest predictors of poor outcome among the included patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this well-characterized COVID-19 ICU cohort, that comprised 12.7% of all severe ill COVID-19 patients, neurologic manifestations increase mortality and morbidity. Since no reliable evidence of direct viral affection of the nervous system by COVID-19 could be found, these neurologic manifestations may for a great part be indirect para- or postinfectious sequelae of the infection or severe critical illness. Neurologic ICU complications should be actively searched for and treated.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Internet programs can reach women who may not access traditional treatments due to distance, stigma or concern about taking medication. We adapted our online postnatal depression program, MumMoodBooster, for antenatal use. We aimed to trial feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the new Mum2BMoodBooster intervention with depressed pregnant women. METHODS: Twenty-seven pregnant women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score > 11 used the program in a feasibility trial. Twenty-one had current diagnoses of major or minor depression on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Assessment of symptoms occurred at screening/baseline, post-test (8 weeks post-enrollment), and at follow-up (3 months postpartum) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). RESULTS: In this feasibility trial, depression scores on both the PHQ-9 and the DASS-21, showed significant reductions representing large effects, with average symptom scores reduced by > 50%, and maintained in the 'minimal or no depression' range at 3 month follow-up. Anxiety scores also decreased significantly. Program usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions. Program acceptability ratings were moderate to high. CONCLUSIONS: Findings paralleled the magnitude of symptom reductions seen in randomised trials of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, suggesting that Mum2BMoodBooster is an effective treatment for depressed pregnant women. Effective internet therapies are likely to become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make face-to-face access to health care problematic during 'lockdowns'.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated an electronic health record (EHR) embedded clinical decision support (CDS) system that leverages machine learning (ML) to estimate short-term risk for clinical deterioration in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.

Incidence of critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h were 10.7% and 22.5%, respectively and were similar across study periods. ML model performance was excellent under all conditions, with AUC ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for prediction of critical care needs and 0.80-0.90 for inpatient care needs.

The study involved 100 subjects, divided into two groups: the study group (50 individuals) comprised subjects who had recovered from mild COVID-19, and the control group (50 individuals) consisted of healthy subjects matched for gender and age. Balance was assessed using a force platform and clinical tests such as: timed up and go test, 15-s step test, sit-to-stand test and 6-min walk test. The assessment on the platform showed greater balance impairments in the trials with eyes closed; more specifically, compared to the controls, in trials with double-leg support the subjects from the study group acquired significantly higher scores in X average (lateral coordinates) (p < 0.05), Path length, V average (average Centre of Foot Pressure Velocity) (p < 0.05) and Area circular (p < 0.01), with even more significant results in trials with single-leg support in X average (p < 0.001), Y average (anterior-posterior coordinates) (p < 0.001) and Path length (p = 0.004). Higher scores in the timed up and go test were found in the study group (p = 0.013). The control group had higher scores in the remaining tests. The current findings show that mild COVID-19 may lead to balance impairments in young adults.

METHODS: 68 muscle biopsies were collected from nine ASD patients at L4-L5 (bilateral multifidus and longissimus sampled). The biopsies were tested for muscle fiber and fiber bundle biomechanical properties and histopathology. The small sample size (due to COVID-19) precluded formal statistical analysis, but the properties were compared to literature data. Changes in spinal loading due to the measured properties were predicted by a lumbar spine musculoskeletal model. RESULTS: Single fiber passive elastic moduli were similar to literature values, but in contrast, the fiber bundle moduli exhibited a wide range beyond literature values, with 22% of 171 fiber bundles exhibiting very high elastic moduli, up to 20 times greater. Active contractile specific force was consistently less than literature, with notably 24% of samples exhibiting no contractile ability. Histological analysis of 28 biopsies revealed frequent fibro-fatty replacement with a range of muscle fiber abnormalities. Biomechanical modelling predicted that high muscle stiffness could increase the compressive loads in the spine by over 500%, particularly in flexed postures. DISCUSSION: The histopathological observations suggest diverse mechanisms of potential functional impairment. The large variations observed in muscle biomechanical properties can have a dramatic influence on spinal forces. These early findings highlight the potential key role of the paraspinal muscle in ASD.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In addition, EMSA assays with SARS-CoV-2 derived RNA hairpin loops from a putative viral packaging sequence showed the preference interaction of the N-CTD to RNA oligonucleotides containing G and the loss of the specificity in the mutant W330A.

Among the proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, main protease (M(pro) also known as 3CL(pro)) is a primary drug target, due to its essential role in maturation of the viral polyproteins. In this study, we provide crystallographic evidence, along with some binding assay data, that three clinically approved anti hepatitis C virus drugs and two other drug-like compounds covalently bind to the M(pro) Cys145 catalytic residue in the active site. Also, molecular docking studies can provide additional insight for the design of new antiviral inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 using these drugs as lead compounds.

Using an integrated approach that combines proteomics and metabolomics data, we investigated the changes in metabolites and proteins in relation to patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and health outcome) and clinical information (e.g., metabolic panel and complete blood count test results). We found significant enrichment of biological indicators of lung, liver, and gastrointestinal dysfunction associated with disease severity using publicly available metabolite and protein profiles. Our analyses specifically identified enriched proteins that play a critical role in responses to injury or infection within these anatomical sites, but may contribute to excessive systemic inflammation within the context of COVID-19.

In this work, we explored the platelet proteome of COVID-19 patients through a label-free shotgun proteomics approach to identify platelet responses to infection, as well as validation experiments in a larger patient cohort. Exclusively detected proteins (EPs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the proteomic dataset and thus classified into biological processes to map pathways correlated with pathogenesis. Significant changes in the expression of proteins related to platelet activation, cell death, and antiviral response through interferon type-I were found in all patients. Since the outcome of COVID-19 varies highly among individuals, we also performed a cross-comparison of proteins found in survivors and nonsurvivors. Proteins belonging to the translation pathway were strongly highlighted in the nonsurvivor group. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was fully sequenced in platelets from five patients, indicating viral internalization and preprocessing, with CD147 as a potential entry route.

We aimed to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic pregnant vs. non-pregnant women in order to establish recommendations for a COVID-19 screening strategy. METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. Asymptomatic pregnant or non-pregnant women after March 2020 (the time when COVID-19 was first detected in north Israel) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test, anti-nucleocapside-IgG and anti-spike-IgG. Diagnosis was made if at least one test was positive. Pregnant women were tested between 34-42 weeks, mostly at birth. RESULTS: Among the 297 participating women, 152 were pregnant and 145 were non-pregnant. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 was similar between the groups (4 (2.6%) and 8 (5.5%), respectively, p=0.2). All women with COVID-19 delivered at term, healthy appropriate-for-gestational-age babies without malformations. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 in pregnant women is low and comparable to the rate among non-pregnant women. Pregnancy outcomes are favorable. Future screening programs should consider that 1 of 25 screened asymptomatic women will be positive.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN OR METHODS: Clinical information was collected from all the patients. RT-PCR and ELISAs were conducted for the detection of COVID-19 using nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was performed for the identification of causative pathogens using BALF, peripheral blood and sputum samples. End point PCR was performed to confirm the mNGS results. RESULTS: All thirty-two patients showed atypical pneumonia and had infection-like symptoms that were similar to COVID-19. Results of RT-PCR and ELISAs ruled out COVID-19 infection. mNGS identified C. psittaci as the suspected pathogen in these patients within 48 hours, which was validated by PCR except for three blood samples. The sequence reads that covered fragments of C. psittaci genome were detected more often in BALF than in sputum or blood samples. All patients received doxycycline-based treatment regimens and showed favourable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study, that enrolled the highest number of C. psittaci pneumonia cases in China so far, suggests that human psittacosis may be underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed clinically, especially in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

A pre-existing nationwide nursing shortage has drastically worsened during the pandemic amid dramatically increasing labor costs. We examine the evolution and financial impact of these changes during repeated pandemic surges within a vascular surgery division at a tertiary medical center. METHODS: Operating room, inpatient unit, and outpatient clinic financial data were examined retrospectively. Monthly averages from a 14-month control cohort, January 2019-February 2020 (Pre-COVID), were compared to five interval groups of sequential, three-month cohorts from March 2020 through November 2021 (Groups 1-7). RESULTS: Monthly RVU generation rebounded to the pre-pandemic mean (2520) after an isolated drop in the early pandemic (Group 1, 1734), with values ranging from 2540 to 2863/month in Groups 2-5, with a slight decline in Groups 6 and 7. The average monthly RVU in the COVID period (2437) was nearly equivalent (p=0.93) to the pre-COVID cohort. Analysis of payor mix demonstrated an increase in commercial and Medicaid payors, with a respective decrease in Medicare payors, during COVID. Contribution to indirect (CTI), or profit, from inpatient hospital and outpatient clinical revenue showed a drastic drop in Group 1 followed by a swift rebound when government restrictions were eased (Group 2). Total monthly vascular nursing unit expense demonstrated a marked increase with each sequential Group during COVID, with an average monthly upsurge of +$82,171 (+47%, p<0.001). An increase in nursing labor expense of +$884 per vascular case ($1630 to $2514, +54%, p<0.001) was observed in the COVID era. Nursing labor costs per patient day increased from $580 to $852 (+$272, +53%, p<0.001). Nursing labor cost per RVU increased from $69.5 to $107.7 (+$38.2, +55%; p<0.001). On a system-wide level, agency-related nursing costs increased from $4.9 to $13.6 million/month (+178%, p<0.001) in 2021 compared to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had a severe, nationwide impact on healthcare delivery, exacerbating the deleterious effects of an existing, critical nursing shortage. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of this phenomenon and its impact on a surgical division. Our results demonstrate a progressive, drastic increase in nursing labor costs during the pandemic, with a resultant, sustained erosion of financial margins despite a level of clinical productivity, as measured in RVU, equal to pre-pandemic standards. Clearly this precarious trend is not sustainable and will require increased, targeted government funding.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a pilot program carried out at the University Jaume I for monitoring the trends of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such project conducted on a university campus in Spain. Wastewater samples (n=838) were collected when students returned to campus, from October 2020 until August 2021, at a confluence sewer point and at the building level including different academic departments and services, the library, administration offices and the university student residence. It has been observed that the probability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater depended on COVID-19 incidence on campus and visitors/occupants of the buildings i.e., high-, or low-traffic buildings with high or low frequency of potential contacts. Moreover, the third wave in Spain (after Christmas 2020) and an outbreak that occurred at the university student's residence could be carefully followed, allowing confirmation of the end of the outbreak. In addition, viral variants (i.e., mutations and linages) from selected time points were detected by sequencing and gave an indication of the evolution of the virus over time. The results illustrate the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology to provide an early warning for SARS-CoV-2 within the university, especially in buildings with low traffic and more defined populations, like the student residence. The strategy and experience gathered in this study will allow for implementation of improvements for reliable monitoring in the future.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

While telemedicine was a nascent means of healthcare delivery prior to COVID-19, it now is one of the principle means for doing so today, and it is likely to remain so. Whether this will happen may depend in part on continued relaxation of regulations that hampered it prior to the pandemic. Whereas enforcement of compliance with HIPAA will most likely resume, platform operators and providers have had an opportunity to prepare for this. State licensure requirements may also resume; however, the regulations were in the process of become more liberal prior to COVID-19 so that process might continue. There is no reason to anticipate that payment for telemedicine services including check-ins, remote physiologic and therapeutic monitoring and relaxation of location and service requirements will end.

However, to date, there have been no reports highlighting the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adults with a prior history of myocarditis, which was the intent of this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Children and adults cared for at the Cleveland Clinic were identified through the electronic health records, who had a history of myocarditis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic AND had subsequently received at least two doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (n=34). Only 1 patient in this series had recurrence of myocarditis confirmed by cardiac MRI after receiving the second dose. He was a White male, who had his first episode of myocarditis at age 20 and was 27 years of age at the time of recurrence. He was hospitalized for 2 days with no need for cardiac support or reported arrhythmias and was stable at outpatient follow up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an old history of non-COVID 19 myocarditis, the risk of recurrent myocarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is low, and when occurs appears to be self-limiting.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to evaluate the global evolution of mental health problems during the pandemic. METHODS: To conduct this systematic review, we searched for published articles from APA PsycInfo (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science. Longitudinal (at least 2 waves during the COVID-19 pandemic) and peer-reviewed articles on mental health problems conducted as from 2020 and after were included in the current study. Of 394 eligible full texts, 64 articles were included in the analysis. We computed random effects, standardized mean differences, and log odds ratio (LOR) with 95% CIs. The meta-analysis protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273624). RESULTS: Results showed that anxiety (LOR=-0.33; 95% CI, -0.54, -0.12) and depression symptoms (LOR=-0.12; 95% CI, -0.21, -0.04) decreased from baseline to follow up. However, other mental health problems showed no change. Higher prevalence rates (40.9%; 95% CI, 16.1%-65.8%) of psychological distress were found in months after July 2020, respectively, while there were no significant month differences for the prevalence of other mental health problems. Higher means of anxiety (d=3.63, 95% CI, 1.66, 5.61), depression (d=3.93; 95% CI, 1.68, 6.17), and loneliness (d=5.96; 95% CI, 3.22, 8.70) were observed in May 2020. Higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD and higher means of anxiety, depression and loneliness were observed in North America. The prevalence of psychological distress and insomnia was higher in Latin America and Europe, respectively. LIMITATIONS: There is a lack of longitudinal studies in some parts of the world, such as Africa, the Caribbean, India, the Middle East, in Latin America, and Asia. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that anxiety and depression symptoms decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic while other mental health problems showed no statistical change. The findings reveal that mental health problems peaked in April and May 2020. Prevalence of mental health problems remains high during the pandemic and mental health prevention, promotion and intervention programs should be implemented to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global population.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

Synaptic loss and neuronal death observed in the regions responsible for cognitive functions represent an irreversible progressive disease that is clinically characterized by impaired cognitive and functional abilities, along with behavioral symptoms. Currently, image and body fluid biomarkers can provide early dementia diagnostic, being it the best way to slow the disease's progression. The first signs of AD development are still complex, the existence of individual genetic and phenotypic characteristics about the disease makes it difficult to standardize studies on the subject. The answer seems to be related between Abeta and tau proteins. Abeta deposition in the medial parietal cortex appears to be the initial stage of AD, but it does not have a strong correlation with neurodegeneration. The strongest link between symptoms occurs with tau aggregation, which antecede Abeta deposits in the medial temporal lobe, however, the protein can be found in cognitively healthy older people. The answer to the question may lie in some catalytic effect between both proteins. Amid so many doubts, Aducanumab was approved, which raised controversies and results intense debate in the scientific field. Abnormal singling of some blood biomarkers produced by adipocytes under high lipogenesis, such as TNFalpha, leptin, and interleukin-6, demonstrate to be linked to neuroinflammation worsens, diabetes, and also severe cases of COVID-19, howsoever, under higher lipolysis, seem to have therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, which has increasingly contributed to the understanding of AD. In addition, the relationship of severe clinical complications caused by Sars-CoV-2 viral infection and AD, go beyond the term \"risk group\" and may be related to the development of dementia long-term.

OBJECTIVES: This investigation aims to describe the phenotypes of cardiovascular symptoms of PASC in patients presenting to the Post-COVID Cardiology Clinic, including their demographics, symptoms, and the clinical phenotypes observed. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of symptoms, clinical findings, and test results from the first 100 consecutive adult patients who presented to the Post-COVID Cardiology Clinic at Washington University in St. Louis, between September 2020 to May 2021 with cardiovascular symptoms following COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The population (n=100) had a mean age of 46.3years and was 81% female. Most patients had mild acute illness, with only 23% of patients requiring hospitalization during acute COVID-19 infection. The most commonly reported PASC symptoms were chest pain (66%), palpitations (59%), and dyspnea on exertion (56%). Of those presenting with these symptoms, 74/98 patients (75.5%) were found to have a significant blood pressure elevation, considerable sinus tachycardia burden, reduced global longitudinal strain, increased indexed left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDVi) by echocardiogram, and/or cMRI findings consistent with possible active or healing myocarditis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the cause of a lymphocyte count drop in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Monocytic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and T cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, DNA damage in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) by immunofluorescence, and Angiotensin II (AngII) by ELISA in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients upon admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU, n=29) or non-ICU (n=29), and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: We show that the monocytes of certain COVID-19 patients spontaneously released ROS able to induce DNA damage and apoptosis in neighboring cells. Of note, high ROS production was predictive of death in ICU patients. Accordingly, in most patients, we observed the presence of DNA damage in up to 50% of their PBMCs, and T-cell apoptosis. Moreover, the intensity of this DNA damage was linked to lymphopenia. SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce the internalization of its receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2, a protease able to catabolize AngII. Accordingly, we observed in certain COVID-19 patients high plasma levels of AngII. Looking for the stimulus responsible for their monocytic ROS production, we unveiled that AngII triggers ROS production by monocytes via Angiotensin receptor I. ROS released by AngII-activated monocytes induced DNA damage and apoptosis in neighboring lymphocytes.

It has already affected over 250 million people worldwide; thereby, there is a need for novel therapies to alleviate the related complications. There is a paradigm shift in developing drugs and clinical practices to combat COVID-19. Several clinical trials have been performed or are testing diverse pharmacological interventions to alleviate viral load and complications such as cytokine release storm (CRS). Kinase-inhibitors have appeared as potential antiviral agents for COVID-19 patients due to their efficacy against CRS. Combination of kinase inhibitors with other therapies can achieve more efficacy against COVID-19. Based on the pre-clinical trials, kinase inhibitors such as Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitors, Brutton's tyrosin kinase (BTK) inhibitors, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitors, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors can be a promising strategy against COVID-19. Kinase inhibitors possess crucial pharmacological properties for a successful re-purposing in terms of dual anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects. This review will address the current clinical evidence and the newest discovery regarding the application of kinase inhibitors in COVID-19. An outlook on ongoing clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) and unpublished data is also presented here.

Long-term exposure to air pollutants as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (<10 mum PM10, <2.5 mum PM2.5) has a negative impact on respiratory functions. We analyze the association between long-term air pollution and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany. METHODS: We conducted an observational study in Germany on county-level, investigating the association between long-term (2010-2019) air pollutant exposure (European Environment Agency, AirBase data set) and COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality rate during the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (open source data Robert Koch Institute). We used negative binominal models, including adjustment for risk factors (age, sex, days since first COVID-19 case, population density, socio-economic and health parameters). RESULTS: After adjustment for risk factors in the tri-pollutant model (NO2, O3, PM2.5) an increase of 1 mug/m(3) NO2 was associated with an increase of the need for intensive care due to COVID-19 by 4.2% (95% CI 1.011-1.074), and mechanical ventilation by 4.6% (95% CI 1.010-1.084). A tendency towards an association of NO2 with COVID-19 incidence was indicated, as the results were just outside of the defined statistical significance (+1.6% (95% CI 1.000-1.032)). Long-term annual mean NO2 level ranged from 4.6 mug/m(3) to 32 mug/m(3).

Deploying an ensemble of sequence space exploratory tools including co-evolutionary analysis and deep mutational scans we provide a quantitative insight into the evolutionarily constrained subspace of the RBD sequence-space. Guided by molecular simulation and structure network analysis we highlight regions inside the RBD, which are critical for providing structural integrity and conformational flexibility. Using fuzzy C-means clustering we combined evolutionary and structural features of RBD and identified a critical region. Subsequently, we used computational drug screening using a library of 1615 small molecules and identified one lead molecule, which is expected to target the identified region, critical for evolvability and structural stability of RBD.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination with menstrual cycle characteristics. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively followed 3,858 pre-menopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study 3 (NHS3) living in the United States or Canada who received biannual follow-up questionnaires between January 2011 and December 2021, and completed additional monthly and quarterly surveys related to the COVID-19 pandemic between April 2020 and November 2021. History of positive SARS-CoV-2 test, COVID-19 vaccination status, and vaccine type were self-reported in surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021. Current menstrual cycle length and regularity \"pre-COVID\" (reported at baseline between 2011-2016) and \"post-COVID\" (reported in late 2021). Pre- to post-COVID change in menstrual cycle length and regularity was calculated between reports. Logistic or multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between (1) SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) COVID-19 vaccination and change in menstrual cycle characteristics. RESULTS: The median age at baseline and end of follow-up were 33 years (range=21-51) and 42 years (range=27-56), respectively, with a median follow-up time of 9.2 years. We documented 421 (10.9%) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 3,527 (91.4%) vaccinations during follow-up. Vaccinated women had a higher risk of increased cycle length compared to those unvaccinated (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.04-2.27), after adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. These associations were similar after additionally accounting for pandemic-related stress. COVID-19 vaccination was only associated with change to longer cycles in the first 6 months after vaccination (0-6 months: OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.08-2.73; 7-9 months: OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.00-2.23; >9 months: OR=1.44, 95% CI=0.93-2.22) and among women whose cycles were short, long or irregular before vaccination (OR=2.87, 95% CI=1.54-5.35; OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.60-1.75 for women with normal length, regular cycles before vaccination). mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines were both associated with this change. SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with changes in usual menstrual cycle characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with short-term changes in usual menstrual cycle length, particularly among women whose cycles were short, long or irregular before vaccination. These results underscore the importance of monitoring menstrual health in vaccine clinical trials. Future work should examine the potential biological mechanisms.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

diseases. The problem to tackle this disease seems to become even worse due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Further, the complications related to drug-resistant TB, prolonged treatment regimens, and synergy between TB and HIV are significant drawbacks. There are several drugs to treat TB, but there is still no rapid and accurate treatment available. Intensive research is, therefore, necessary to discover newer molecular analogs that can probably eliminate this disease within a short span. An increase in efficacy can be achieved through re-engineering old TB-drug families and repurposing known drugs. These two approaches have led to the production of newer classes of compounds with novel mechanisms to treat multidrug-resistant strains. With respect to this context, we discuss structural aspects of developing new anti-TB drugs as well as examine advances in TB drug discovery. It was found that the fluoroquinolone, oxazolidinone, and nitroimidazole classes of compounds have greater potential to be further explored for TB drug development. Most of the TB drug candidates in the clinical phase are modified versions of these classes of compounds. Therefore, here we anticipate that modification or repurposing of these classes of compounds has a higher probability to reach the clinical phase of drug development. The information provided will pave the way for researchers to design and identify newer molecular analogs for TB drug development and also broaden the scope of exploring future-generation potent, yet safer anti-TB drugs.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft."], "FAU": ["Reddy, Dinesh S", "Sinha, Anamika", "Kumar, Amit", "Saini, Vipin K"], "AU": ["Reddy DS", "Sinha A", "Kumar A", "Saini VK"], "AD": ["Centre for Nano and Material Sciences, Jain University, Bangalore, India.", "Centre for Nano and Material Sciences, Jain University, Bangalore, India.", "Centre for Nano and Material Sciences, Jain University, Bangalore, India.", "Materials and Environmental Chemistry Research Laboratory, School of Environment & Natural Resources, Doon University, Dehradun, India."], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9760-6233"], "LA": ["eng"], "GR": ["CS/097/2013/Science and Engineering Research Board", "SB/FT/CS-100/2013/Science and Engineering Research Board", "Jain University/Centre for Nano and Material Sciences (CNMS), Jain University"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "Germany", "TA": "Arch Pharm (Weinheim)", "JT": "Archiv der Pharmazie", "JID": "0330167", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["drug discovery", "re-engineering", "repurposing", "tuberculosis"], "EDAT": "2022/07/17 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/17 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/16 13:00"], "PHST": ["2022/06/14 00:00 [revised]", "2022/04/22 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/17 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/16 13:00 [entrez]", "2022/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/17 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1002/ardp.202200214 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2022 Jul 15:e2200214. doi: 10.1002/ardp.202200214."}, {"PMID": "35841517", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "2193-8253 (Print) 2193-6536 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 16", "TI": "Letter to the Editor regarding \"COVID-19-Related Burden and Risk Perception in Individuals with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy and Multifocal Motor Neuropathy: A Cross-Sectional Study\".", "LID": "10.1007/s40120-022-00386-0 [doi]", "FAU": ["Finsterer, Josef"], "AU": ["Finsterer J"], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2839-7305"], "AD": ["Neurology & Neurophysiology Center, Postfach 20, 1180, Vienna, Austria. fifigs1@yahoo.de."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Letter"], "DEP": "20220716", "PL": "New Zealand", "TA": "Neurol Ther", "JT": "Neurology and therapy", "JID": "101637818", "PMC": "PMC9288203", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Anxiety", "COVID-19", "Depression", "Neuroimmunology", "SARS-CoV-2"], "EDAT": "2022/07/17 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/17 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/16 11:30"], "PHST": ["2022/05/15 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/30 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/16 11:30 [entrez]", "2022/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/17 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1007/s40120-022-00386-0 [doi]", "10.1007/s40120-022-00386-0 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Neurol Ther. 2022 Jul 16. pii: 10.1007/s40120-022-00386-0. doi: 10.1007/s40120-022-00386-0."}, {"PMID": "35841507", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "1614-7499 (Electronic) 0944-1344 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 16", "TI": "Bicycle industry as a post-pandemic green recovery driver in an emerging economy: a SWOT analysis.", "LID": "10.1007/s11356-022-21985-2 [doi]", "AB": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed socioeconomic vulnerabilities around the world. After fighting the coronavirus for more than 1 and a half years now, the countries are recovering from the epidemic with the help of cutting-edge medical research. The policymakers are implementing stimulus packages for post-pandemic economic recovery. However, sustainable \"green recovery\" plans are yet to get adequate attention. Sustainable investment in green industries can create green jobs, promote a low-carbon economy, and foster long-lasting economic growth in the post-pandemic world. COVID-19 affected countries with emerging economies call for even more focus on such investments. In Bangladesh, the bicycle industry - a growing low-carbon industry - has been showing promising potential for growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Both the local and global markets of Bangladeshi bicycles have seen substantial growth during the epidemic. In this paper, we analyze the potential of the Bangladeshi bicycle industry as an effective green recovery driver.

We evaluated the benefits and limitations of using text-based outreach to re-engage with LTFU PrEP patients and offer re-initiation of PrEP care. Using text-messaging, we surveyed San Francisco City Clinic patients who started PrEP from January 2015 to October 2019 and were LTFU by October 1, 2020. Our goals were to better understand (1) whether our patients remained on PrEP through another provider or source, (2) why patients choose to discontinue PrEP, and (3) whether text-based outreach could successfully re-engage such patients in care. Multiple-choice survey questions were analyzed quantitatively to determine the proportion of respondents selecting each option; free-text responses were analyzed qualitatively using an inductive approach to identify any additional recurring themes. Of 846 eligible survey recipients, 130 responded (overall response rate 15.4%). Forty-two respondents (32.3%) were still on PrEP through another provider while 88 (67.7%) were not. Common reasons for stopping PrEP included: COVID-19-related changes in sex life (32.3% of responses), concerns regarding side effects (17.7%), and the need to take a daily pill (8.3%). Free text responses revealed additional concerns regarding risk compensation. While 32 participants agreed to be contacted by City clinic staff for PrEP counseling, only 6 were reached by phone and none of the six subsequently restarted PrEP. We learned that text messaging is a possible approach to survey certain PrEP program participants to determine who is truly LTFU and off PrEP, and to better understand reasons for PrEP discontinuation. While such information could prove valuable as programs seek to address barriers to PrEP retention, efforts to improve acceptability and increase response rates would be necessary. We were less successful in re-engaging LTFU patients in PrEP care, suggesting that text-messaging may not be the optimal strategy for this purpose.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Some of these viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for this purpose. Viral non-structural proteins are essential for DMV biogenesis, but they cannot form without an original membrane from a host cell organelle and a significant supply of lipids. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the initial mechanisms of autophagic processes have been shown to be essential for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 DMVs. However, by analogy with other DMV-inducing viruses, it seems likely that the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and lipid droplets are also involved. As for hepatitis C virus (HCV), pores crossing both membranes of SARS-CoV-2-induced DMVs have been identified. These pores presumably allow the supply of metabolites essential for viral replication within the DMV, together with the export of the newly synthesized viral RNA to form the genome of future virions. It remains unknown whether, as for HCV, DMVs with open pores can coexist with the fully sealed DMVs required for the storage of large amounts of viral RNA. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed many similarities in the mechanisms of DMV biogenesis and morphology between these two phylogenetically distant viruses. An understanding of the mechanisms of DMV formation and their role in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV-2 may be essential for the development of new antiviral approaches against this pathogen or other coronaviruses that may emerge in the future.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

For patients, digital technologies improve convenience and may reduce stigma; however, privacy concerns in the home may limit their utilization. Providers also benefit from the convenience of these technologies; however, not all providers are comfortable delivering virtual care to SGM. For society, digital technologies reduce transportation-related costs and increase access to healthcare in an increasingly hostile political climate for SGM; however, these advantages are limited by technological access and anti-SGM policies. Digital technologies can improve the behavioral health of SGM at the patient, provider, and systemic levels.

In such risky settings, blood donation services must increase donations. Service quality can increase donations but its evaluation only amounts to a cognitive evaluation, and not to an emotional appraisal. Consequently, both service quality and emotions should be considered when predicting donor behaviour. In fact, donating blood is an emotionally charged service, thus representing an ideal setting to investigate how emotions influence consumer behaviour. This research proposes a new method to predict blood donors' intentions by integrating a cognitive approach measuring perceived quality, and an emotional approach including anticipated emotions (both positive and negative) of 'donation' and 'non-donation'. Based on a sample of 30,621 active Spanish donors, it is concluded that service quality is an antecedent for anticipated emotions and that both service quality and anticipated emotions influence donor loyalty. Designing the donation process based on quality criteria would provoke encouraging emotions and diminish discouraging emotions, therefore improving donor loyalty.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The risk of getting seriously ill after infection with SARS-COV-2 during the present COVID-19 pandemic amplifies with age, suggesting that face masks should be worn especially during face-to-face contact with and between older people. However, the ability to accurately perceive and understand communication signals decreases with age, and it is currently unknown whether face masks impair facial communication more severely in older people. We compared the impact of surgical face masks on dynamic facial emotion recognition in younger (18-30 years) and older (65-85 years) adults (N = 96) in an online study. Participants watched short video clips of young women who facially expressed anger, fear, contempt or sadness. Faces of half of the women were covered by a digitally added surgical face mask. As expected, emotion recognition accuracy declined with age, and face masks reduced emotion recognition accuracy in both younger and older participants. Unexpectedly, the effect of face masks did not differ between age groups. Further analyses showed that masks also reduced the participants' overall confidence in their emotion judgements, but not their performance awareness (the difference between their confidence ratings for correct and incorrect responses). Again, there were no mask-by-age interactions. Finally, data obtained with a newly developed questionnaire (attitudes towards face masks, atom) suggest that younger and older people do not differ in how much they feel impaired in their understanding of other people's emotions by face masks or how useful they find face masks in confining the COVID-19 pandemic. In sum, these findings do not provide evidence that the impact of face masks on the decoding of facial signals is disproportionally larger in older people.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

To provide support and prevent long-term mental health problems, we culturally adapted a psychological first aid guide specifically for COVID-19 frontline workers serving AI/AN communities. We engaged a diverse, collaborative work group to steer the adaptation content and process. We also held two focus group discussions with frontline workers in AI/AN communities to incorporate their perspectives into the adapted guide. Results from the group discussions and the collaborative work group were compiled, analyzed to extract themes and suggestions, and integrated into the adapted content of the guide. Main adaptations included updating language (i.e., to be more culturally appropriate, less prescriptive, and less text heavy), framing the guide from a harm-reduction lens, incorporating cultural activities, values, and teachings common across diverse AI/AN communities (e.g., importance of being a good relative), and validating feelings and experiences of frontline workers. The resulting adapted guide includes four modules and is available as a free online training.

The aim of the study was to quantify these risks compared to a control population cohort, during the period March 2020-May 2021, in Bologna, northern Italy. METHOD: ParkLink Bologna cohort (759 PD; 192 PS) and controls (9,226) anonymously matched (ratio 1:10) for sex, age, district, comorbidity were included. Data were analysed in the whole period and in the two different pandemic waves (March-May 2020 and October 2020-May 2021). RESULTS: Adjusted hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.3 (95% CI 1.04-1.7) in PD and 1.9 (1.3-2.8) in PS compared to the controls. The trend was detected in both the pandemic waves. Adjusted hazard ratio of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 1.1 (95% CI 0.8-1.7) in PD and 1.8 (95% CI 0.97-3.1) in PS. A higher risk of hospital admission was detected in PS only in the first wave. The 30-day mortality risk after hospitalization was higher (p=0.048) in PS (58%) than in PD (19%) and controls (26%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, after adjustment for key covariates, people with PD and PS showed a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the first 15 months of the pandemic.

METHODS: antiviral activity of chlorine dioxide based oral rinse (OR) solutions were tested by pre-incubating with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus in a dosage-dependent manner before transducing to human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293T-ACE2) cells which stably expresses ACE-2 receptor. Viral entry was determined by measuring luciferase activity using a luminescence microplate reader. In the cell-to-cell fusion assay, effector Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells co-expressing spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and T7 RNA polymerase were pre-incubated with the ORs before co-culturing with the target CHO-K1 cells co-expressing human ACE2 receptor and luciferase gene. The luciferase signal was quantified 24 hours after mixing the cells. Surface expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE-2 receptor was confirmed using direct fluorescent imaging and quantitative cell-ELISA. Finally, dosage-dependent cytotoxic effects of ORs were evaluated at two different time points. RESULTS: A dosage-dependent antiviral effect of the ORs were observed against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and spike glycoprotein mediated cell-to-cell fusion. This demonstrates that ORs can be useful as a preprocedural step to reduce viral infectivity.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was employed in this study. METHODS: The data were collected with an online survey between October and December 2020 from 901 participants in Turkey. Participants completed the Descriptive Information Form, the Marital Adjustment Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale. Multivariate analysis of variance and moderation analysis were used in the analysis of the data. RESULTS: The pre-pandemic marital adjustment scores of the participants significantly decreased during the pandemic. The marital adjustment and sexual life of those with high perceived stress levels were found to be negatively affected, and they were exposed to violence during the pandemic. In the moderation analysis, a non-standardized coefficient of the marital adjustment variable in the model turned out to be significant, and the perceived stress decreased as marital adjustment increased. The marital adjustment was low, and the stress level was high in individuals exposed to violence. Besides, perceived stress was found to be effective in being exposed to intimate partner violence. CONCLUSION: The stress perceived by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected their marital adjustment and sexual life. Besides, perceived stress was found to be effective in being exposed to intimate partner violence, and marital adjustment decreased during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. IMPACT: During the pandemic period, health care providers should routinely screen the psychosocial health of individuals. Continuous, accessible, free psychosocial support services should be available in order to increase the psychosocial health and marital adjustment of people with high-stress levels and prevent exposure to violence.

DESIGN: A quantitative rapid review of the literature. DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and Scopus for English language papers published between December 2019 (initial onset of the pandemic) to March 2021. REVIEW METHODS: Using the World Health Organization and Cochrane guidelines for rapid reviews, following an identification of relevant papers and data extraction, a narrative synthesis approach was used to develop themes. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Four themes identified from data synthesis were nature and extent of disruptions to clinical supervision, unmet need for psychological support, supervisors also need support and unpacking telesupervision. Findings highlight the extent and nature of disruption to clinical supervision at the point of care. Further information on factors that facilitate high-quality telesupervision have come to light. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous burden on healthcare workers compromising their own health and well-being. It is essential to restore effective clinical supervision practices at the point of care, so as to enhance patient, healthcare worker and organizational outcomes into the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. IMPACT: This review has provided initial evidence on the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical supervision of healthcare workers and students at the point of care.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic may affect the work engagement of nurses who have direct contact with infected patients and lead to a poor quality of care. Identifying classification features of work engagement and tailoring interventions to support frontline nurses is imperative. DESIGN: This study utilized a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-five nurses were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from 14 February to 15 April 2020. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify classification features of work engagement. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine predictors of profile membership. RESULTS: A four-profile model provided the best fit. The four profiles were titled 'low work engagement' (n = 99), 'high vigour-low dedication and absorption' (n = 58), 'moderate work engagement' (n = 63) and 'high work engagement' (n = 135). A regression analysis suggested that young nurses and nurses who were the only children of their family were more likely to be in the 'low work engagement' and 'high vigour-low dedication and absorption' groups. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of tailoring interventions for frontline supporting nurses by considering their distinct work engagement patterns, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to improve the promotion of work satisfaction and quality of care. IMPACT: This was the first study to explore the latent profiles of work engagement in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 40% of nurses were in the 'low work engagement' and 'high vigour-low dedication and absorption' groups and reported low levels of work engagement. Understanding different patterns of work engagement in frontline nurses can help nursing managers provide emotional, material and organizational support based on the features of each latent profile, which may improve the quality of care and patient safety.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."], "FAU": ["Yin, Yizhen", "Lyu, Mengmeng", "Zuo, Man", "Yao, Shuyu", "Li, Hui", "Li, Juan", "Zhang, Jie", "Zhang, Jingping"], "AU": ["Yin Y", "Lyu M", "Zuo M", "Yao S", "Li H", "Li J", "Zhang J", "Zhang J"], "AD": ["Xiangya Nursing School, Central South University, Changsha, P.R.

producers and stakeholders based on their perceptions of effectiveness and use of COVID-19 protective behaviors. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of agricultural producers and stakeholders through Qualtrics. Participants responded to 7 statements about COVID-19 protective behavior effectiveness and 7 statements about participation in COVID-19 protective behaviors in the previous 2 weeks. These statements included handwashing, disinfecting, refraining from touching one's face, covering one's face when coughing/sneezing, staying at home, social distancing, and wearing a face mask. Additional survey sections included demographics and health history. We performed separate latent class analysis (LCA) to identify clusters of agricultural producers' and stakeholders' perceptions and participation in COVID-19-related protective behaviors based on their pattern of responses. FINDINGS: Based on LCA, participants were distributed as universal believers (33%), social believers (16%), personal believers (26%), moderate believers (17%), and social skeptics (85%) of effectiveness and as low (15%), moderate (40%), and high (45%) adherents of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Those who were female, older, or had underlying health conditions were more likely to be universal believers and highly adherent. High adherence was also more likely among those who lived in urban areas or were not self-employed. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that groups of agricultural producers and stakeholders based on perception of effectiveness and participation in COVID-19 protective behaviors are associated with demographic and health characteristics. Public health campaigns that increase or maintain motivation to comply with protective behaviors should be developed and implemented specific for agricultural populations.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Authors.

Currently few studies have directly compared vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). AIMS: Our aim was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of vaccine recipients and unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU in a nationwide setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the Short PeRiod IncideNce sTudy of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Australia, in 57 ICUs during Delta and Omicron predominant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and ICU mortality. RESULTS: 2,970 patients were admitted to ICU across participating sites from 26 June 2021 to 8 February 2022. 1,134 (38.2%) patients were vaccine recipients, and 1,836 (61.8%) patients were unvaccinated. Vaccine recipients were older, more comorbid, and less likely to require organ support. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was greater in the vaccinated cohort. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbid status, no statistically significant association between in-hospital or ICU mortality, and vaccination status, was apparent. CONCLUSION: We found COVID-19 infection can cause severe disease and death in vaccine recipients, though comorbid status and older age were significant contributors to mortality. Organ support requirements and the number of deaths were highest in the unvaccinated cohort. This article is protected by copyright.

availability.", "LID": "10.1111/jth.15821 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: Erythrocyte aggregation is a phenomenon that is commonly found in several pathological disease states: stroke, myocardial infarction, thermal burn injury, and COVID-19. Erythrocyte aggregation is characterized by rouleaux, closely packed stacks of cells, forming three-dimensional structures. Healthy blood flow monodisperses the red blood cells (RBCs) throughout the vasculature; however, in select pathological conditions, involving hyperthermia and hypoxemia, rouleaux formation remains and results in occlusion of microvessels with decreased perfusion. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to address the kinetics of rouleaux formation with sudden cessation of flow in variable temperature and oxygen conditions. METHODS: RBCs used in this in vitro system were obtained from healthy human donors. Using a vertical stop-flow system aligned with a microscope, images were acquired and analyzed for increased variation in grayscale to indicate increased aggregation. The onset of aggregation after sudden cessation of flow was determined at proscribed temperatures (37-49( degrees ) C) and oxygen (0, 10%), and in the presence and absence of DIDS (4, 4'-Diisothiocyano-2, 2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid). Both autologous and homologous plasma were tested. RESULTS: RBCs in autologous plasma aggregate faster and with a higher magnitude with both hyperthermia and hypoxemia. Preventing deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) from binding to band 3 with DIDS (dissociates the cytoskeleton from the membrane) fully blocks aggregation.

METHODS: Cases were retrospectively collected through passive epidemiological surveillance. The overall observed incidence was calculated according to the total number of administered doses. Vaccines were analyzed individually and by vector as mRNA-based (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2), adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCov-19, rAd26-rAd5, Ad5-nCoV, and Ad26.COV2-S), and inactivated whole-virion-vectored (CoronaVac). RESULTS: We identified 97 patients (52 [53.6%] males; median age 44 years (IQR 33-60), for an overall observed incidence of 1.19/1,000,000 doses (95% CI 0.97-1.45), higher among Ad26.COV2-S (3.86/1,000,000 doses, 95% CI 1.50-9.93) and BNT162b2 (1.92/1,00,000 doses, 95% CI 1.36-2.71) recipients.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, US SSPs underwent unprecedented shifts in operational procedures (e.g., closures of physical sites, staff redeployment into pandemic response efforts). Given the critical role of US SSP workers in the pandemic, we sought to explore the occupational experiences and well-being of SSP staff to inform future emergency response efforts. METHODS: From July-October 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with staff members of four SSPs in diverse regions of Massachusetts. Trained interviewers administered qualitative interviews virtually. Interviews were coded in NVivo v12 and thematic analysis identified common occupational experiences and related impacts on staff well-being in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among 18 participants, 12 (67%) had client-facing roles such as harm reduction specialists and six (33%) worked in program management or leadership. We found that staff were frequently anxious about SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which contributed to staff turnover. SSPs rapidly adapted and expanded their services to meet increasing client needs during the pandemic (e.g., food distribution, COVID-19 testing), leading to staff overexertion. Simultaneously, public health measures such as physical distancing led to staff concerns about reduced social connections with clients and coworkers. Through these challenges, SSPs worked to protect staff well-being by implementing flexible and tangible COVID-19-related policies (e.g., paid sick leave), mental health resources, and frequent communication regarding pandemic-related operational changes. CONCLUSION: SSPs in the USA adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic out of necessity, resulting in operational changes that threatened staff well-being. Despite the protective factors revealed in some narratives, our findings suggest that during prolonged, complex public health emergencies, SSPs may benefit from enhanced occupational supports to prevent burnout and promote wellness for this essential public health workforce.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Mental health (MH) and substance use disorders (SUD) represent obstacles to HIV care in rural areas lacking Medicaid expansion and infrastructure. Evidence-informed technologies, such as telehealth, may enhance SUD and MH services but remain understudied in rural regions. METHODS: We conducted a readiness assessment using a mixed methods approach to explore opportunities for enhanced SUD and MH screening using electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) and telehealth at five Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-funded clinics in AL. Clinic providers and staff from each site (N = 16) completed the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change (ORIC) assessment and interviews regarding existing services and readiness to change. People with HIV from each site (PLH, N = 18) completed surveys on the acceptability and accessibility of technology for healthcare. RESULTS: Surveys and interviews revealed that all clinics screen for depression annually by use of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). SUD screening is less frequent and unstandardized. Telehealth is available at all sites, with three of the five sites beginning services due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, telehealth for MH and SUD services is not standardized across sites. Results demonstrate an overall readiness to adopt standardized screenings and expand telehealth services beyond HIV services at clinics. There were several concerns including Wi-Fi access, staff capacity, and patients' technological literacy. A sample of 18 people with HIV (PWH), ages 18 to 65 years, participated in surveys; all demonstrated adequate technology literacy. A majority had accessed telehealth and were not concerned about it being too complicated or limiting communication. There were some concerns around lack of in-person interaction and lack of a physical exam and high-quality care with telehealth. CONCLUSION: This study of PWH and the clinics that serve them reveals opportunities to expand SUD and MH services in rural regions using technology. Areas for improvement include implementing routine SUD screening, expanding telehealth while maintaining opportunities for in-person interaction, and using standardized ePROs that are completed by patients, in order to minimize stigma and bias.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the seroprevalence of people with underlying diseases and the dynamic change features of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: We selected 100 communities in Wuhan using the probability-proportional-to-size sampling method. From these 100 communities, we randomly selected households according to a list provided by the local government. Individuals who have lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since December 2019 and were >/= 40 years old were included. From April 9-13, 2020, community staff invited all selected individuals to the community healthcare center in batches by going door-to-door or telephone. All participants completed a standardized electronic questionnaire simultaneously. Finally, 5 ml of venous blood was collected from all participants. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. During the period June 11-13, 2020 and October 9-December 5, 2020, all family members of a positive family and matched negative families were followed up twice. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in people with underlying diseases was 6.30% (95% CI [5.09-7.52]), and that of people without underlying diseases was 6.12% (95% CI [5.33-6.91]). A total of 313 people were positive for total antibodies at baseline, of which 97 had underlying disease. At the first follow-up, a total of 212 people were positive for total antibodies, of which 66 had underlying disease. At the second follow-up, a total of 238 people were positive for total antibodies, of which 68 had underlying disease. A total of 219 participants had three consecutive serum samples with positive total antibodies at baseline. The IgG titers decreased significantly with or without underlying diseases (P < 0.05) within the 9 months at least, while the neutralizing antibody titer remained stable. The titer of asymptomatic patients was lower than that of symptomatic patients (baseline, P = 0.032, second follow-up, P = 0.018) in the underlying diseases group. CONCLUSION: Our research focused on the serological changes of people with and without underlying diseases in a state of single natural infection. Regardless of the underlying diseases, the IgG titer decreased significantly over time, while there was no significant difference in the decline rate of IgG between with and without underlying diseases. Moreover, the neutralizing antibody titer remained relatively stable within the 9 months at least.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the United States, access to buprenorphine remains low and disparities regarding who receives treatment have emerged. Federal laws have regulated buprenorphine delivery, ultimately limiting its implementation more broadly. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal agencies acted quickly to remove a legal barrier, effectively allowing people with opioid used disorder (OUD) to initiate buprenorphine treatment via telemedicine. Leveraging this policy shift, a low barrier buprenorphine treatment initiative via telemedicine was started at syringe service programs in California. We assessed early findings from participants reached by this model of treatment. METHODS: In May 2020, buprenorphine treatment was offered through a virtual platform to SSP participants in California. SSP staff connected interested participants to virtual appointments with medical providers in a private location. During these visits, clinicians conducted clinical assessments for diagnosing participants with OUD and developed an unsupervised home induction plan for individuals who were eligible. Participants were prescribed a 7-day supply of up to 16 mg daily buprenorphine or 16 mg buprenorphine-2 mg naloxone and asked to return the following week if interested in continuing treatment. RESULTS: From May 2020 to March 2021, the SSP-buprenorphine virtual care initiative inducted 115 participants onto treatment with 87% of participants inducted on the same day as their referral. Of those inducted, 58% were between the ages of 30 and 49 and 28% were cisgender female. Regarding participants' method of payment to reimburse buprenorphine costs, 92% of participants were covered by Medicare/Medicaid. Overall, 64% of participants returned for a second buprenorphine prescription refill. CONCLUSIONS: These early findings suggest that this could be a promising approach to improve equity and access to buprenorphine treatment. We encourage policymakers to continue allowing buprenorphine delivery via telemedicine and researchers to study whether this approach improves equity and access to treatment throughout the United States.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The purpose of this review was to explore and map the scientific literature on the health impact of COVID-19 and related restrictive measures during the first and second wave among nursing home residents. A specific focus was placed on health data collected among nursing home residents themselves. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, best practices for scoping reviews were followed. Five databases were systematically searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published up until December 2020 in which data were collected among nursing home residents. Articles were categorized according to the type of health impact (physical, social and/or psychological) and study focus (impact of COVID-19 virus or related restrictive measures). Findings were presented using a narrative style. RESULTS: Of 60 included studies, 57 examined the physical impact of COVID-19. All of these focused on the direct impact of the COVID-19 virus. These studies often used an observational design and quantitative data collection methods, such as swab testing or reviewing health records. Only three studies examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 of which one study focused on the impact of COVID-19-related restrictive measures. Findings were contradictory; both decreased and improved psychological wellbeing was found during the pandemic compared with before. No studies were found that examined the impact on social wellbeing and one study examined other health-related outcomes, including preference changes of nursing home residents in Advanced Care planning following the pandemic. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Studies into the impact of the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among nursing home residents predominantly focused on the physical impact. Future studies into the psychological and social impact that collect data among residents themselves will provide more insight into their perspectives, such as lived experiences, wishes, needs and possibilities during later phases of the pandemic. These insights can inform policy makers and healthcare professionals in providing person-centered care during the remaining COVID-19 pandemic and in future crisis periods.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

This paper describes the protocol of a nation-wide clinical trial conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to assess the effectiveness of a virtual tobacco treatment intervention and the process of implementing tobacco treatment in NCORP community oncology settings. METHODS/DESIGN: This two-arm, multisite (n: 49 NCORP sites) hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness of a Virtual Intervention Treatment (VIT) versus an Enhanced Usual Control (EUC) among English and Spanish speaking patients recently diagnosed with cancer, reporting current smoking and receiving care at a participating NCORP Community or Minority/Underserved Site. The VIT includes up to 11 virtual counseling sessions with a tobacco treatment specialist and up to 12 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The EUC arm receives a referral to the NCI Quitline. The primary study outcome is biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence. Moderators of treatment effect will be assessed. The study evaluates implementation processes from participating NCORP site staff via survey, administrative, and focus group data, including reach, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, feasibility, adoption, cost and sustainability outcomes. DISCUSSION: This trial will generate findings about the effectiveness of an evidence-based virtual tobacco treatment intervention targeting patients diagnosed with cancer and illuminate barriers and facilitators that influence implementing tobacco treatment into community oncology settings nationally. In the era of COVID-19, virtual care solutions are vital for maximizing access and utilization of tobacco treatment delivery.

resource availability in many Asian countries. This has been reported as a contributing factor to the spread of several outbreaks, including COVID-19. Despite these reports, very little is known about the risk of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) transmission related to the involvement of family and private carers in the clinical setting. As a starting point to understanding this issue, this study aimed to provide insights regarding the patient care activities undertaken by family and private carers and the guidance provided to these carers around infection control measures in hospitals located in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea. METHOD: A qualitative study involving 57 semi-structured interviews was undertaken in five tertiary level hospitals across the selected countries. Two groups of individuals were interviewed: (1) patients and their family carers and private carers; and (2) healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, hospital managers and staff members. Drawing upon the principles of grounded theory, an inductive approach to data analysis using thematic analysis was adopted. RESULTS: Five main themes were generated from the analysis of the data: (1) expectation of family carers staying with a patient; (2) residing in the patient's environment: (3) caring activities undertaken by family carers; (4) supporting and educating family carers and (5) communication around healthcare-associated infection and infection prevention and control. CONCLUSION: Based on the types of activities being undertaken, coupled with the length of time family and private carers are residing within the clinical setting, coupled with an apparent lack of guidance being given around IPC, more needs to be done to ensure that these carers are not being inadvertently exposed to HAI's or other occupational risks.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Initial strategies focused on vaccinating the elderly to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, but with vaccines becoming available to the broader population, it became important to determine the optimal strategy to enable the safe lifting of NPIs while avoiding virus resurgence. METHODS: We extended the classic deterministic SIR compartmental disease-transmission model to simulate the lifting of NPIs under different vaccine rollout scenarios. Using case and vaccination data from Toronto, Canada between December 28, 2020, and May 19, 2021, we estimated transmission throughout past stages of NPI escalation/relaxation to compare the impact of lifting NPIs on different dates on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, given varying degrees of vaccine coverages by 20-year age groups, accounting for waning immunity. RESULTS: We found that, once coverage among the elderly is high enough (80% with at least one dose), the main age groups to target are 20-39 and 40-59 years, wherein first-dose coverage of at least 70% by mid-June 2021 is needed to minimize the possibility of resurgence if NPIs are to be lifted in the summer. While a resurgence was observed for every scenario of NPI lifting, we also found that under an optimistic vaccination coverage (70% coverage by mid-June, along with postponing reopening from August 2021 to September 2021) can reduce case counts and severe outcomes by roughly 57% by December 31, 2021.

Some viruses enter the host cell through the endocytosis process and involve some endocytosis proteins, such as the Rab family. However, the relationship between SARS CoV-2 infection with endocytic mRNA RAB5, RAB7, and RAB11B is unknown. This study aims to compare the expression of RAB5, RAB7, and RAB11B between positive and negative COVID-19 patient groups. RESULTS: Both viral and human epithelial RNA Isolation and RT-PCR were performed from 249 samples. The genes expression was analysed using appropriate statistical tests. We found the Median (inter-quartile range/IQR) of RAB5, RAB7, and RAB11B expression among the COVID-19 patient group was 2.99 (1.88), 0.17 (0.47), 0.47 (1.49), and 1.60 (2.88), 1.05 (2.49), 1.10 (3.96) among control group respectively. We proceeded with Mann Whitney U Test and found that RAB5 expression was significantly increased (P < 0.001), and RAB7 and RAB11B expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.001 and P = 0.036) in the COVID-19 patient group compared to the control group.

Gaining the ability to adapt and thrive under pressure will be key to addressing this. We explore what characterises risk, vulnerability and resilient responses of HCWs during the early stages of the outbreak in Singapore. METHODS: We undertook qualitative theory-guided thematic analysis of e-diary entries from HCWs who navigated the outbreak from June-August 2020. Data were extracted from a subset of an online survey of n = 3616 participants collected across 9 institutions, including restructured hospitals, hospices and affiliated primary care partners. RESULTS: N = 663 or 18% submitted qualitative journal entries included for analyses. All professional cadres, local as well as foreign HCWs participated. Themes are reported according to the Loads-Levers-Lifts model of resilience and highlighted in italics. The model assumes that resilience is a dynamic process. Key factors threatening mental health (loading) risk included a notable rise in anxiety, the effects of being separated from loved ones, and experiencing heightened emotions and emotional overload. Bad situations were made worse, prompting vulnerable outcomes when HCWs experienced stigma in the community and effects of \"public paranoia\"; or under conditions where HCWs ended up feeling like a prisoner with little control or choice when either confined to staff accommodation or placed on quarantine/Stay Home Notices. Those with strife in their place of residence also described already difficult situations at work being aggravated by home life. Protection (lifts) came from being able to muster a sense of optimism about the future or feeling grateful for the pace of life slowing down and having the space to reprioritise. In contrast, when risk factors were present, balancing these in the direction of resilient outcomes was achieved by choosing to re-direct stress into positive narratives, drawing on inner agency, uptake of therapeutic activities, social support as well as faith and prayer and drawing comfort from religious community among other factors. CONCLUSION: The Loads-Levers-Lifts model is used to guide analysis to inform intervention designs. Levers promoting resilience through targeting therapies, workplace policies and awareness campaigns accounting for identified loads are proposed.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

With complete eradication unlikely, organizations will need to evaluate their risk and the benefits of mitigation strategies, including the effects of regular asymptomatic testing. We developed a web application and R package that provides estimates and visualizations to aid the assessment of organizational infection risk and testing benefits to facilitate decision-making, which combines internal and community information with malleable assumptions. RESULTS: Our web application, covidscreen, presents estimated values of risk metrics in an intuitive graphical format. It shows the current expected number of active, primarily community-acquired infections among employees in an organization. It calculates and explains the absolute and relative risk reduction of an intervention, relative to the baseline scenario, and shows the value of testing vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. In addition, the web interface allows users to profile risk over a chosen range of input values. The performance and output are illustrated using simulations and a real-world example from the employee testing program of a pediatric oncology specialty hospital. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, covidscreen can assist organizations in making informed decisions about whether to incorporate covid test based screening as part of their on-campus risk-mitigation strategy.

Data portability and informational self-determination are fundamental concepts of MyData. This study analysed the factors that influence acceptance of the MyData platform, which, reflects the right to self-determine personal data. METHODS: The study involved participants having experience using the MyData platform, and the key factors of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology were used in the research model (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitation condition and behavioural intention to use). The questionnaire comprided 27 items, and system usage log data were used to confirm that behavioural intention to use affected actual use behaviour through structural equation modeling. RESULTS: In total, 1153 participants completed the survey. The goodness of fit in the structural equation model indices indicates that the data fit the research model well. Performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions had direct effects on behavioural intention to use. We used system usage log data to confirm that behavioural intention to use positively affected actual use behaviour. The impact of the main factors in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was not moderated by age or gender, except for performance expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine the factors influencing the use of the MyData platform based on the personal health record data sharing system in Korea. In addition, the study confirmed the use behaviour of the MyData platform utilising the system's actual usage log for each function and analysing the effect of the intention of use on actual use.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the status of the TRYCAT pathway, including the levels of TRP and kynurenine (KYN) and the activity of IDO, as measured by the ratio of KYN/TRP. METHODS: This systematic review searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Sciences and included 14 articles that compared TRP and tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) in COVID-19 patients versus non-COVID-19 controls, as well as severe/critical versus mild/moderate COVID-19. The analysis was done on a total of 1269 people, including 794 COVID-19 patients and 475 controls. RESULTS: The results show a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in the KYN/TRP ratio (standardized mean difference, SMD = 1.099, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.714; 1.484) and KYN (SMD = 1.123, 95% CI: 0.730; 1.516) and significantly lower TRP (SMD = - 1.002, 95%CI: - 1.738; - 0.266) in COVID-19 versus controls.

Mortality rates show a sharp increase with advancing age but with the large heterogeneity of this population in terms of comorbidities, vulnerability and disabilities, identifying risk factors is difficult. Therefore, we aimed to research the multidimensional concept of frailty, measured by the Acute Presenting Older Patient (APOP)-screener, as a risk factor for in-hospital mortality in older COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All consecutive patients of 70 years or older, with a PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection and a completed APOP-score, presenting at the Emergency Department (ED) of the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, the Netherlands, between February 27th 2020 and February 1st 2021 were retrospectively included. We gathered baseline characteristics and scored the CCI and CFS from patient records. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 292 patients met the inclusion criteria. Approximately half of the patients were considered frail by the APOP or CFS. 127 patients (43.5%) scored frail on the CFS, 158 (54.1%) scored high risk on the APOP-screener. 79 patients (27.1%) died during their hospital admission. The APOP-screener showed a significantly elevated risk of in-hospital mortality when patients scored both high risk of functional and evidence of cognitive impairment (OR 2.24, 95% 1.18-4.25). Significant elevation of in-hospital mortality was found for the high CCI-scores (>/= 5)(OR 1.78, 95% 1.02-3.11), but not for the highest CFS category (5-9, frail) (OR 1.35, 95% 0.75-2.47). The discriminatory performance of the APOP, CFS and CCI were comparable (AUC resp. 0.59 (0.52-0.66), 0.54 (0.46-0.62) and 0.58 (0.51-0.65)). CONCLUSION: Although the elevated risk for in-hospital mortality found for the most frail patients as scored by the APOP, this instrument has poor discriminatory value. Additionally, the CFS did not show significance in predicting in-hospital mortality and had a poor discriminatory value as well. Therefore, treatment decisions based on frailty or comorbidities alone should be made with caution. Approaching the heterogeneity of the older population by adding frailty as assessed by the APOP-score to existing prediction models may enhance the predictive value of these models.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with seasonal coronavirus (sCoV) infection and COVID-19 to compare their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: A total of 190 patients hospitalized with any documented respiratory tract infection and a positive respiratory viral panel for sCoV from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2020, were included. Those patients were compared with 190 hospitalized adult patients with molecularly confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 admitted from March 1, 2020, to May 25, 2020. RESULTS: Among 190 patients with sCoV infection, the Human Coronavirus-OC93 was the most common coronavirus with 47.4% of the cases. When comparing demographics and baseline characteristics, both groups were of similar age (sCoV: 74 years vs. COVID-19: 69 years) and presented similar proportions of two or more comorbidities (sCoV: 85.8% vs. COVID-19: 81.6%). More patients with COVID-19 presented with severe disease (78.4% vs. 67.9%), sepsis (36.3% vs. 20.5%), and developed ARDS (15.8% vs. 2.6%) compared to patients with sCoV infection. Patients with COVID-19 had an almost fourfold increased risk of in-hospital death than patients with sCoV infection (OR 3.86, CI 1.99-7.49; p < .001). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had similar demographics and baseline characteristics to hospitalized patients with sCoV infection; however, patients with COVID-19 presented with higher disease severity, had a higher case-fatality rate, and increased risk of death than patients with sCoV. Clinical findings alone may not help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19 during high acute respiratory illness seasons. The respiratory multiplex panel by PCR that includes SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with local epidemiological data may be a valuable tool to assist clinicians with management decisions.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

As it is well-known that regular physical activity has positive effects on individual physical and mental health and thus is an important prerequisite for healthy aging, digital technologies are also increasingly used to promote unstructured and structured forms of physical activity. However, in the course of this development, several terms (e.g., Digital Health, Electronic Health, Mobile Health, Telehealth, Telemedicine, and Telerehabilitation) have been introduced to refer to the application of digital technologies to provide health-related services such as physical interventions. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned terms are often used in several different ways, but also relatively interchangeably.

Children with chronic diseases including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at higher risk of food insecurity due to their complex care needs, medication burden, and dietary restrictions. No data exists describing food insecurity prevalence in pediatric ESKD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Food insecurity was assessed among families of children (age 0-18 years) with ESKD on chronic dialysis at two pediatric academic medical centers. Families were screened in April 2020 using the Hunger Vital Sign, a validated 2-question screening tool. We assessed impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity. We compared serum phosphorus \"pre-COVID\" (January/February 2020) to \"during COVID\" (April/May 2020). RESULTS: A total of 29 families enrolled in this study. 62% (18/29) of children with ESKD lived in food insecure households, and of those, 72% (13/18) reported that COVID-19 had worsened their food insecurity status. During the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecure patients experienced greater rise in their serum phosphorus levels (1.1 mg/dL vs. 0 mg/dL, p = 0.03) and decreased likelihood of having adequate phosphorus control (50% vs. 11%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Food insecurity was common among children with ESKD on chronic dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with food insecurity had a greater increase in their phosphorus levels during the pandemic than did food secure children.

High body temperature activates the immune system, which might be beneficial. However, shivering leads to high oxygen demand. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU). His oxygen saturation (SpO2) level was approximately 92-95% and was managed with a high flow nasal cannula. Six hours after admission to the ICU, he started shivering, and his systolic blood pressure rose above 200 mmHg. Concomitantly, his SpO2 levels decreased rapidly. Mechanical ventilation was started, but oxygenation could not be maintained, requiring the establishment of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

We developed the Lung AIR (awareness, information, and resources) intervention to increase community education regarding lung cancer screening. The intervention was designed as an in-person group intervention; however, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated adapting the mode of delivery. In this study we examined intervention feasibility and efficacy overall and by mode of delivery (in-person group vs. one-on-one phone) to understand the impact of adapting community outreach and engagement strategies. Feasibility was examined through participant demographics. Efficacy was measured through pre/post knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about lung cancer screening, and intention to complete screening. We reached N = 292 participants. Forty percent had a household income below $35,000, 58% had a high school degree or less, 40% were Hispanic, 57% were Black, and 84% reported current or past smoking. One-on-one phone sessions reached participants who were older, had lower incomes, more current smoking, smoked for more years, more cigarettes per day, lower pre-intervention lung cancer screening knowledge, and higher pre-intervention fear and worry. Overall pre/post test scores show significant increases in knowledge, salience, and coherence, and reduced fear and worry. Participants in the one-on-one phone sessions had significantly higher increases in salience and coherence and intention to complete screening compared to participants in the in-person group sessions.

A state of low-grade chronic inflammation in obesity has been suggested as one of the underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether obesity is associated with differences in new inflammatory biomarkers mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), C-terminal proendothelin-1 (CT-proET-1), and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 105 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were divided in patients with obesity (body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 kg/m(2), n = 42) and patients without obesity (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), n = 63) and studied in a retrospective observational cohort study. MR-proADM, CT-proET-1 concentrations, and conventional markers of white blood count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) were collected during the first 7 days. RESULTS: BMI was 33.5 (32-36.1) and 26.2 (24.7-27.8) kg/m(2) in the group with and without obesity. There were no significant differences in concentrations MR-proADM, CT-proET-1, WBC, CRP, and PCT at baseline and the next 6 days between patients with and without obesity. Only MR-proADM changed significantly over time (p = 0.039). Also, BMI did not correlate with inflammatory biomarkers (MR-proADM rho = 0.150, p = 0.125, CT-proET-1 rho = 0.179, p = 0.067, WBC rho = -0.044, p = 0.654, CRP rho = 0.057, p = 0.564, PCT rho = 0.022, p = 0.842). Finally, no significant differences in time on a ventilator, ICU length of stay, and 28-day mortality between patients with or without obesity were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, obesity was not associated with differences in MR-proADM, and CT-proET-1, or impaired outcome.

METHODS: Using descriptive statistics, we report on the characteristics and short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing radical cancer treatment during the first COVID-19 wave compared to a similar pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, the number of patients undergoing radical treatment in 2020 reduced by: 28% for surgery; 18% for SACT; and 10% for RT. Within SACT, 36% received combination therapy, 35% systemic chemotherapy, 23% targeted treatments, 5% immunotherapy and 2% biological therapy. A similar proportion of RT was delivered in 2019 and 2020 (53% vs. 52%). Oncological outcomes were also similar to pre-COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection rates were low: 12 patients were positive pre surgery (1%), 7 post surgery (<1%), 17 SACT patients (2%) and 3 RT patients (<1%). No COVID-19-related deaths were reported.

Airway epithelial cells play a vital role in the early defence against viruses via their barrier and immune functions. We investigated viral replication and immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected bronchial epithelial cells from healthy paediatric (n = 6; 2.5-5.6 years old) and adult (n = 4; 47-63 years old) subjects and compared cellular responses following infection with SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A H1N1. While infection with either virus triggered robust transcriptional interferon responses, including induction of type I (IFNB1) and type III (IFNL1) interferons, markedly lower levels of interferons and inflammatory proteins (IL-6, IL-8) were released following SARS-CoV-2 compared to H1N1 infection. Only H1N1 infection caused disruption of the epithelial layer. Interestingly, H1N1 infection resulted in sustained upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors FURIN and NRP1. We did not find any differences in the epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between paediatric and adult cells.

Due to these forced restrictions, the pollution levels in cities across the country drastically decreased within just a few days. Since traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting regional air quality, congestion has a significant impact on the environment. Therefore, using the aid of air quality data for six pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and O3) from 11 monitoring stations (located in urban, suburban and urban-industrial regions) across Ji'nan, we employed the air quality index (AQI) to investigate the spatial pattern of air quality in the pre-COVID-19 (pre-COVID) and COVID-19-related lockdown (COVID lockdown) periods. The results showed that air quality significantly improved during the COVID lockdown period. Among the selected pollutants, compared to the corresponding pre-COVID levels, the greatest reduction was observed for the concentration of NO2 (54.02%), while the smallest reduction was observed for the concentration of SO2 (27.92%). The PM2.5 (38.73%), PM10 (44.92%) and CO (30.60%) levels also decreased during the COVID lockdown period; only the O3 concentration increased (37.42%) during this period. Overall, air quality improved by approximate improvements of 37.33% during the COVID lockdown period. Approximately 35.48%, 37.01% and 43.43% in the AQI were observed in urban, suburban and urban-industrial regions, respectively. Therefore, the AQI exhibited remarkable regional differences in Ji'nan. This study demonstrates the contributions of the transportation sector and local emissions to improving air quality in typical urban areas, and these research results can provide guidance for the further monitoring of air pollution in northern Chinese cities.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

A random-effects model was used to analyze the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and fear symptoms in the student population during the COVID-19 epidemic. Of the 146,330 records retrieved, we included 104 studies (n = 2,088,032). The quality of included studies was moderate. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the student population during the epidemic was 32.0% (95% CI [28.0-37.0%]); anxiety symptoms was 28.0% (95% CI [24.0-32.0%]); stress symptoms was 31.0% (95% CI [23.0-39.0%]); and fear symptoms was 33.0% (95% CI [20.0-49.0%]). The prevalence differed by gender, epidemic stage, region, education stage, student major and assessment tool. The prevalence of psychological stress in the student population during the COVID-19 epidemic may be higher compared to the global prevalence of psychological stress. We need to alleviate psychological stress in the student population in a targeted manner to provide mental health services to safeguard the student population.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Knowledge of the risk and direction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between humans and potential reservoir hosts is essential for effective disease control and prioritisation of interventions. Using genomic data, we reconstruct the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 in humans and deer, estimate the case finding rate and attempt to infer relative rates of transmission between species. We found no evidence of direct or indirect transmission from deer to human. However, with an estimated case finding rate of only 4.2%, spillback to humans cannot be ruled out.

mild cases, necessitate systematic investigation into the prevalence and type of lasting illness. Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, that may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. Here, 1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of disease provided detailed medical and psychosocial information. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Secondary analyses evaluated sex differences, timing of infection, and impact of prior mental health problems. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. 70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptom after recovery. 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported lasting mood or cognitive/memory problems. Perceived discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. This effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, not to general stress levels. Further, patient perceptions regarding quality of medical care influenced these relationships. Finally, illness early in the pandemic is associated with more severe illness and more frequent lasting complaints. Lasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.

METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were prospectively determined in 81 AIH patients and 53 healthy age- and sex-matched controls > 7 days (median 35) after the first COVID-19 booster vaccination. The spike-specific T-cell response was assessed using an activation-induced marker assay (AIM) in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Median antibody levels were significantly lower in AIH compared to controls (10908 vs. 25000 AU/mL, p<0.001), especially in AIH patients treated with MMF (N=14, 4542 AU/mL, p=0.004) or steroids (N=27, 7326 AU/mL, p=0.020). Also, 48% of AIH patients had antibody titers below the 10% percentile of the healthy controls (9194 AU/mL, p<0.001). AIH patients had a high risk of failing to develop a spike-specific T-cell response (15/34 (44%) vs. 2/16 (12%), p=0.05) and showed overall lower frequencies of spike-specific CD4+T cells (median: 0.074% vs 0.283;p=0.01) after the booster vaccination compared to healthy individuals. In 34/81 patients, antibody titers before and after booster vaccination were available. In this subgroup, all patients but especially those without detectable/low antibodies titers (<100 AU/mL) after the second vaccination (N=11/34) showed a strong, 148-fold increase. CONCLUSION: A third COVID-19 vaccination efficiently boosts antibody levels and T-cell responses in AIH patients and even seroconversion in patients with absent immune response after two vaccinations, but to a lower level compared to controls. Therefore, we suggest routinely assessing antibody levels in AIH patients and offering additional booster vaccinations to those with suboptimal response.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

To combat an ongoing pandemic, governmental resources are largely allocated toward supporting the health of the public and economy. This shift in attention can lead to security vulnerabilities which are exploited by terrorists. In view of this, counterterrorism during a pandemic is of critical interest to the safety and well-being of the global society. Most notably, the population flows among potential targets are likely to change in conjunction with the trend of the health crisis, which leads to fluctuations in target valuations. In this situation, a new challenge for the defender is to optimally allocate his/her resources among targets that have changing valuations, where his/her intention is to minimize the expected losses from potential terrorist attacks. In order to deal with this challenge, in this paper, we first develop a defender-attacker game in sequential form, where the target valuations can change as a result of the pandemic. Then we analyze the effects of a pandemic on counterterrorism resource allocation from the perspective of dynamic target valuations.

Candida albicans (C. albicans) constitutes an important component of the human mycobiome and the most common cause of invasive fungal infections. Invasive yeast infections are gaining interest among the scientific community as a consequence of complications associated with severe COVID-19 infections. Early identification and surveillance for Candida infections is critical for decreasing the COVID-19 mortality. Our current study attempted to understand the molecular-level interactions between the human genes in different organs during systematic candidiasis. Our research findings have shed light on the molecular events that occur during Candidiasis in organs such as the kidney, liver, and spleen. The differentially expressed genes (up and down-regulated) in each organ will aid in designing organ-specific therapeutic protocols for systemic candidiasis. We observed organ-specific immune responses such as the development of the acute phase response in the liver; TGF-pathway and genes involved in lymphocyte activation, and leukocyte proliferation in the kidney. We have also observed that in the kidney, filament production, up-regulation of iron acquisition mechanisms, and metabolic adaptability are aided by the late initiation of innate defense mechanisms, which is likely related to the low number of resident immune cells and the sluggish recruitment of new effector cells. Our findings point to major pathways that play essential roles in specific organs during systemic candidiasis. The hub genes discovered in the study can be used to develop novel drugs for clinical management of Candidiasis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Determinants during the life course also play a role. We therefore examined the health situation in Ukraine before Russia's invasion in 2022 and its relevance for health care for Ukrainian refugees in Germany from the perspective of the Public Health Service. METHOD: Rapid search in the Medline data base, and in relevant Ukrainian and international health data bases; narrative synthesis of findings, followed by a prioritization of health problems and interventions by two medical doctors, using the risk matrix approach. RESULTS: Immunization coverage is low for Covid-19, resulting in outbreaks in refugee shelters. There are vaccination gaps for measles and other basic immunizations, particularly in older children; children aged 2-5 years have not received the second measles dose. HIV and TB therapies may be interrupted due to the need to flee. Among elderly refugees, insufficiently treated cardiovascular diseases and pre-existing psychological trauma as well as cancers in need of acute care predominate. Ukrainian refugees may mistrust state-associated health measures, as the vaccination gaps indicate. CONCLUSION: Refugees should be able to access curative and preventive health care without bureaucratic obstacles and entitlement restrictions.

METHODS: A review of current literature and recommendations as well as discussion with infectious disease specialists at our institutions was completed to identify the impact of vaccines on the immune system and current recommendations for vaccination in patients undergoing elective surgery. RESULTS: The literature on COVID-19 vaccine safety in patients undergoing elective surgery is limited and there is evidence of acute reactions to the vaccination that are largely self-limiting however may cause confusion in diagnosis during the perioperative period.

It is well known that COVID-19 infection predominately affects the lungs; however, the cardiovascular complications of the disease have been a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease are vulnerable to contract a severe form of the illness and increased mortality.

Due to the increased use of the Internet and social media, along with the development of communication technology, information has spread faster and farther during the COVID-19 infodemic. Moreover, the increased choice of information sources has made it more difficult to make sound decisions regarding information. Although social media is the most common source of misinformation, it can also be spread through other forms of media. However, the media sources used by people with high health literacy and COVID-19 knowledge to obtain information is unclear. Furthermore, the association between the use of multiple information sources and health literacy or COVID-19 knowledge is ill-defined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the following three aspects regarding COVID-19 infodemic: (1) the relationship between health literacy, COVID-19 knowledge, and the number of information sources used; (2) the impact of media use on health literacy; (3) the impact of media use on COVID-19 knowledge. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in November 2021. Participants were 477 individuals aged 20-69 years. After obtaining consent to participate in the study, participants were asked about sociodemographic indicators, sources of health-related information, health literacy, and COVID-19 knowledge. Sources of health-related information were categorized into four types: mass media, digital media, social media, and face-to-face communication. Spearman's rank correlation test was conducted to determine the relationship between health literacy, number of correct answers to COVID-19 knowledge, and number of information sources used. Multiple regression analysis was conducted with health literacy and the number of correct answers as dependent variables, the four media types as independent variables, and age and gender as adjustment variables. RESULTS: Mass media was the most frequently used source of information, followed by digital media, face-to-face communications, and social media. Social media use was significantly higher among individuals aged 20-29 years than among other age groups. Significant positive correlations were found between health literacy, number of positive responses to COVID-19 knowledge, and number of information sources used. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that health literacy was associated with access to information from digital media and face-to-face communication. Additionally, COVID-19 knowledge was associated with access to information from mass media, digital media, and face-to-face communication. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and COVID-19 knowledge could be improved using diverse information sources, especially by providing opportunities to use digital media and face-to-face communication. Furthermore, it may be important to improve health literacy and provide accurate knowledge about COVID-19 to young adults.", "FAU": ["Inoue, Mami", "Shimoura, Kanako", "Nagai-Tanima, Momoko", "Aoyama, Tomoki"], "AU": ["Inoue M", "Shimoura K", "Nagai-Tanima M", "Aoyama T"], "AD": ["Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53, Kawahara-cho, ShogoinSakyo-ku, Kyoto, JP.", "Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53, Kawahara-cho, ShogoinSakyo-ku, Kyoto, JP.", "Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53, Kawahara-cho, ShogoinSakyo-ku, Kyoto, JP.", "Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53, Kawahara-cho, ShogoinSakyo-ku, Kyoto, JP."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "Canada", "TA": "J Med Internet Res", "JT": "Journal of medical Internet research", "JID": "100959882", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 15:32"], "PHST": ["2022/07/15 15:32 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.2196/38332 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jul 13. doi: 10.2196/38332."}, {"PMID": "35839345", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220715", "IS": "1747-6356 (Electronic) 1747-6348 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 15", "TI": "Characteristics of our hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia patients receiving corticosteroids and mortality-associated factors.", "LID": "10.1080/17476348.2022.2102480 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a disease associated with diffuse lung injury that has no proven effective treatment yet. It is thought that glucocorticoids may reduce inflammation-mediated lung injury, disease progression, and mortality. We aimed to evaluate our patient's characteristics and treatment outcomes who received corticosteroids for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study and reviewed 517 patients admitted due to COVID-19 pneumonia who were hypoxemic and administered steroids regarding demographic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment response, and mortality-associated factors. RESULTS: Of our 517 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were hypoxemic and received corticosteroids, the mortality rate was 24.4% (n = 126). The evaluation of mortality-associated factors revealed that age, comorbidities, a CURB-65 score of >/= 2, higher SOFA scores, presence of MAS, high doses of steroids, type of steroids, COVID-19 treatment, stay in the intensive care unit, high levels of d-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and troponin, and renal dysfunction were associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Due to high starting and average steroid doses are more associated with mortality, high-dose steroid administration should be avoided.

This review selected DILI articles from 2021 we felt held the greatest interest and clinical relevance. AREAS COVERED: : A literature search was conducted using PubMed between March 1, 2021 and February 28, 2022, and 86 articles were included. This review discusses new and established cases of hepatotoxins, including new FDA approvals and COVID-19 therapeutics. Developments in biomarkers as well as causality assessment methods are discussed. Updates from registries are also explored. EXPERT OPINION: : DILI diagnosis and prognostication remain challenging. Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is the best option for determining causality and has been increasingly accepted by clinicians. Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method (RECAM) may be more user-friendly and accurate but requires further validation. Quantitative systems pharmacology methods, such as DILIsym, are increasingly used to predict hepatotoxicity. Oncotherapeutic agents represent many newly approved and described causes of DILI. Such hepatotoxicity is deemed acceptable relative to the benefit these drugs offer. Drugs developed for non-life-threatening disorders may not show a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio and will be more difficult to approve. As the COVID-19 landscape evolves, its effect on DILI deserves further investigation.", "FAU": ["Woo, Stephanie M", "Alhaqqan, Dalal M", "Gildea, Daniel T", "Patel, Palak A", "Cundra, Lindsey B", "Lewis, James H"], "AU": ["Woo SM", "Alhaqqan DM", "Gildea DT", "Patel PA", "Cundra LB", "Lewis JH"], "AD": ["Department of Internal Medicine, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA.", "Department of Gastroenterology, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA.", "Department of Internal Medicine, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA.", "Department of Internal Medicine, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA.", "Department of Internal Medicine, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA.", "Department of Gastroenterology, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., USA."], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0003-2162-4739"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "England", "TA": "Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol", "JT": "Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology", "JID": "101278199", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["DILI", "Drug-induced liver injury", "RECAM", "RUCAM", "Revised Electronic Causality Assessment Method", "Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method", "hepatotoxicity"], "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 15:12"], "PHST": ["2022/07/15 15:12 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1080/17474124.2022.2101996 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2022 Jul 15. doi: 10.1080/17474124.2022.2101996."}, {"PMID": "35839323", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220715", "IS": "1935-3227 (Electronic) 1932-0620 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 16", "TI": "Providing Low-barrier Addiction Treatment Via a Telemedicine Consultation Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Los Angeles, County: An Assessment 1 Year Later.", "LID": "10.1097/ADM.0000000000001034 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: Los Angeles County Department of Health Services provides medical care to a diverse group of patients residing in underresourced communities. To improve patients' access to addiction medications during the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles County Department of Health Services established a low-barrier telephone service for DHS providers in March 2020, staffed by DATA-2000-waivered providers experienced with prescribing addiction medications. This study describes the patient population and medications prescribed through this service during its initial 12 months. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of a provider-entered call registry for the telephone consult line. Information was collected between March 31, 2020, and March 30, 2021. The registry includes information related to patient demographics, the reason for visit, and which addiction medications were prescribed. We conducted descriptive statistics in each of these domains. RESULTS: During the study period, 11 providers on the MAT telephone service logged 713 calls. These calls represented a total of 557 unique patients (mean age of 40 years, 75% male, 41% Latino, 49% experiencing homelessness). Most patients either had Medicaid insurance (77%) or were uninsured (20%). The most prescribed addiction medication was buprenorphine-naloxone (90%), followed by nicotine replacement therapy (5.3%), naltrexone (4.2%), and buprenorphine monotherapy (1.8%). CONCLUSION: A telephone addiction medication service is feasible to deliver low-barrier medications to treat addiction in underresourced communities, especially to individuals experiencing homelessness. This can mitigate but does not eliminate disparities in access to addiction medications for communities of color.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Written work prepared by employees of the Federal Government", "as part of their official duties is, under the U.S. Copyright Act, a \"work of the", "United States Government\" for which copyright protection under Title 17 of the", "United States Code is not available.

Concerns were raised about the impact of these restrictions on young children's emotional wellbeing. The aim of this study was to explore parents' perceptions of young children's emotional wellbeing during these COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: We interviewed 20 parents of children 3-4 years due to begin school in England in September 2020. Interviews were conducted via telephone (n=18) and video call (n=2), audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interviews focused on childcare arrangements, children's behaviour and transition to school. A sample of transcripts were coded line-by-line to create a coding framework, which was subsequently applied to the remaining transcripts. Coded data were then analysed using a nurture lens to develop themes and further understanding. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly mothers (n=16), White British (n=10), and educated to degree level (n=13), with half the sample living in the highest deprivation quintile in England (n=10). Five were single parents. Three themes developed from nurturing principles were identified: creating age-appropriate explanations; understanding children's behaviour; concerns about school transition. Parents reported that their children's emotional wellbeing was impacted and described attempts to support their young children whilst looking ahead to their transition to primary school. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to examine in-depth perceptions of COVID-19 restrictions on young children's emotional wellbeing. The longer-term impacts are not yet understood. Although young children may be unable to understand in detail what the virus is, they undoubtedly experience the disruption it brings to their lives. The wellbeing of families and children needs to be nurtured as they recover from the effects of the pandemic to allow them to thrive.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

Gingival tissue possess SARS-CoV-2 entry and transmission factors, among them ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2), which are the principal mediators of the virus cell invasion. Clinical observations reveal SARS-CoV-2 RNA in periodontal tissues and crevicular fluid, suggesting that the periodontium may act as an entry point for the virus and/or as a dissemination site. The preliminary observations prove infection potential of gingival crevicular fluid and shed epithelial cells from the periodontium. There are also findings on potential associations between periodontitis and Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). PubMed and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as: SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, oral virus infection, gingival crevicular fluid, oral mucosa, periodontium, gingiva, ACE2, TMPRSS2, Furin, diagnosis, topical treatment, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by the author. The review addressed seven major domains: periodontal structures as SARS-CoV-2 infection site, the periodontal changes under SARS-CoV-2 infection, potential associations between periodontitis and Covid-19, periodontal oral care in Covid-19, crevicular fluid as potential transmission factor and preventive measures.

However, in Ghana, most COVID-19 mitigating packages are not focused on vulnerable populations. METHODS: Concurrent mixed methods design was used to examine the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 among rural and urban-slum dwellers in Ghana. Four hundred respondents were sampled for the quantitative arm of the study, while 46 In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted with community members and government officials. Sixty-four community members participated in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and non-participant observation was carried out for three months. Quantitative data were analysed using frequencies, percentages, Pearson Chi2 and ordered logistic regression. Interviews were recorded using digital recorders and later transcribed. Transcribed data (IDIs, FGDs) and observation notes were uploaded onto a computer and transferred to qualitative software NVivo 12 to support thematic coding and analysis. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents confirmed the deleterious socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 on jobs and prices of food. Other effects were fear of visiting a health facility even when unwell, depression and anxiety. Young people (18-32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals, the employed and low-income earners (those who earn GHC10/$1.7 to GHC100/ $17), were more likely to suffer from the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19. Urban-slum dwellers coped by relying on family and social networks for food and other basic necessities, while rural dwellers created locally appropriate washing aids to facilitate hand washing in the rural communities. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and the government's mitigation measures had negative socio-economic and health effects on vulnerable communities. While vulnerable populations should be targeted for the government's COVID-19 mitigating packages, special attention should be given to young people (18-32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals and low-income earners.

Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic factors and trusted information sources associated with downloading and reasons for not downloading. RESULTS: Of the included 4,503 respondents (36% response rate), 1,394 (31%) had downloaded an app. Demographic and socioeconomic factors positively associated with app download were: 1) being female, 2) higher household income, 3) higher education level attained, and 4) more liberal political views. The odds of downloading an app were higher for participants who trusted health-related information sources, and lower for those who trusted internet searches, family and friend, or Facebook.

This study aimed to determine the characteristics, clinical profiles, and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) and recruited COVID-19 patients admitted between June 1st and September 30th, 2021. Patients' demographics, date of admission and discharge, comorbid conditions, immunization status for COVID-19 infection, presenting complaints, lab workup and computed tomography (CT) scan findings were obtained from the medical records. The primary outcome of the study was patients' condition at discharge and the secondary outcomes included level of care, length of stay (LOS), requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and inotropic support. RESULTS: Among a cohort of 434 patients, 37.7% (n = 164), 6.6% (n = 29) and 55.5% (n = 241) were fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated, respectively. Around 3% and 42.9% of the patient required inotropic and NIV support respectively; however, there was no discernible difference between them in terms of vaccination status. In case of unvaccinated patients there were significantly increased number of critical care admissions (p-value 0.043). Unvaccinated patients had significantly higher median serum procalcitonin, ferritin, LDH and D-dimer levels. Around 5.3% (n = 23) of the patient required invasive ventilation and it was more common in unvaccinated patients (p-value 0.04). Overall, mortality rate was 12.2% (n = 53) and this was higher (16.2%, n = 39) in unvaccinated patients as compared to fully vaccinated patients (6.1%, n = 10, p-value 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Through this preliminary data, we can conclude that patient can develop severe and critical COVID-19 infection despite being vaccinated but this proportion is low as compared to unvaccinated population. So, uninterrupted endeavors need to be done to vaccinate as many individuals as possible. Furthermore, more effective vaccinations need to be developed to lessen the high death toll of COVID-19 infection.", "FAU": ["Fatima, Samar", "Zafar, Amara", "Afzal, Haris", "Ejaz, Taymmia", "Shamim, Sara", "Saleemi, Shayan", "Subhan Butt, Amna"], "AU": ["Fatima S", "Zafar A", "Afzal H", "Ejaz T", "Shamim S", "Saleemi S", "Subhan Butt A"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4617-129X", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8748-8763", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4466-1364"], "AD": ["Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.", "Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/prevention & control", "Critical Care", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "Respiration, Artificial"], "PMC": "PMC9286242", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/20 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 13:34"], "PHST": ["2022/03/07 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/12 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/15 13:34 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/20 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0270485 [doi]", "PONE-D-22-06757 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 15;17(7):e0270485. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0270485. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35839175", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220719", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "1532-0987 (Electronic) 0891-3668 (Linking)", "VI": "41", "IP": "8", "DP": "2022 Aug 1", "TI": "Orbito-Frontal Cortex Hypometabolism in Children With Post-COVID Condition (Long COVID): A Preliminary Experience.", "PG": "663-665", "LID": "10.1097/INF.0000000000003578 [doi]", "AB": "We describe 3 children with new-onset neurocognitive problems after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), that showed, at the brain [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, hypometabolism in the left orbito-frontal region.

Methods: For each study, we assessed and synthesized the outcomes by relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) combined with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 8 studies involving 2442 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated in this meta-analysis.

In this work, we introduce a hierarchical computational approach for atomistic modeling of allosteric mechanisms in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike proteins and present evidence of a frustration-based allostery as an important energetic driver of the conformational changes and spike activation. By examining conformational landscapes and the residue interaction networks in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike protein structures, we have shown that the Omicron mutational sites are dynamically coupled and form a central engine of the allosterically regulated spike machinery that regulates the balance and tradeoffs between conformational plasticity, protein stability, and functional adaptability. We have found that the Omicron mutational sites at the inter-protomer regions form regulatory hotspot clusters that control functional transitions between the closed and open states. Through perturbation-based modeling of allosteric interaction networks and diffusion analysis of communications in the closed and open spike states, we have quantified the allosterically regulated activation mechanism and uncover specific regulatory roles of the Omicron mutations. Atomistic reconstruction of allosteric communication pathways and kinetic modeling using Markov transient analysis reveal that the Omicron mutations form the inter-protomer electrostatic bridges that operate as a network of coupled regulatory switches that could control global conformational changes and signal transmission in the spike protein. The results of this study have revealed distinct and yet complementary roles of the Omicron mutation sites as a network of hotspots that enable allosteric modulation of structural stability and conformational changes which are central for spike activation and virus transmissibility.", "FAU": ["Verkhivker, Gennady M", "Agajanian, Steve", "Kassab, Ryan", "Krishnan, Keerthi"], "AU": ["Verkhivker GM", "Agajanian S", "Kassab R", "Krishnan K"], "AUID": ["ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4507-4471"], "AD": ["Keck Center for Science and Engineering, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA.", "Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Irvine, CA 92618, USA.", "Department of Pharmacology, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. verkhivk@chapman.edu.", "Keck Center for Science and Engineering, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA.", "Keck Center for Science and Engineering, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA.", "Keck Center for Science and Engineering, Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "England", "TA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "JT": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "JID": "100888160", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 12:32"], "PHST": ["2022/07/15 12:32 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1039/d2cp01893d [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Phys Chem Chem Phys. 2022 Jul 15. doi: 10.1039/d2cp01893d."}, {"PMID": "35839034", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220719", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "1536-5964 (Electronic) 0025-7974 (Linking)", "VI": "101", "IP": "28", "DP": "2022 Jul 15", "TI": "Clinical features and mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU according to SOFA score.", "PG": "e29206", "LID": "10.1097/MD.0000000000029206 [doi]", "AB": "The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) could function as an effective risk stratification tool in the admission of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and would allow stratification based on a risk assessment.

The study aimed to investigate in a French monocentric cohort and other European cohorts the presence of symptom clusterization and its possible connection to illness categories to help medical first-line screening and orientation in the pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study describing clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected children admitted to pediatric ED to assess the presence of symptom clustering. A scoping review of the literature was performed to further investigate symptom clusters. RESULTS: Of 1086 tested children, 48 tested positive to SARS-CoV-2. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of our sample were fully described. Two distinct clusters of clinical phenotypes were identified as well as their potential association with illness categories in SARS-CoV-2-infected children.

INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Injections of 0.5% procaine in the stellate ganglion (SG) and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), and in clinically relevant points in the scalp, thorax, and abdomen were performed 3 times over 3 months. The patient reported progressive improvement and was asymptomatic upon completing the treatment. Prescribed medications were discontinued. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score showed significant improvement across all SF-36-domains.

Although the biological properties and safety of the representative Kampo, Hochuekkito (HET), and Kakkonto (KKT) have been confirmed in various animal model experiments and clinical studies, and in a few human studies to induce biological effects on various infectious diseases without significant toxicity, it is unclear whether HET and KKT are safe and effective for COVID-19 prevention. We summarized the clinical characteristics of HCWs and the preventive effects of HET and KKT. We performed a retrospective, single-center, cohort study that included 175 HCWs (aged 21-77 years) from a total number of 217 in a hospital with a history of COVID-19 cluster infection. In total, 175 HCWs were tested for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. We identified 27 patients (median age: 49 +/- 10.7 years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The patients in the group that had a body mass index >/= 25 had a high COVID-19 infection risk, while those in the group with a Kampo formula adherence rate >/= 40% had a low COVID-19 risk. Patients in the group with an adherence rate >/= 40%, as well as those in the current alcohol consumption group, were at a low risk of developing severe COVID-19.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the OPH COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Team was established to help manage the spread of COVID-19 and support individuals who test positive, and their close contacts. INTERVENTION: In order to guide and support the COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Team, the COVID-19 Strategic Support Team implemented an anonymous internal communication tool called the COVID-19 Case Management Forum. Case and Contact Management employees were invited to submit their questions, concerns, and words of encouragement on the forum, and the COVID-19 Strategic Support Team routinely replied to forum submissions via team email. OUTCOMES: Qualitative analyses of employee forum submissions revealed 6 main themes and 31 unique sub-themes related to questions, concerns, and feelings that arose throughout this pandemic response. Recurrent themes emerged relating to process questions, communication challenges, solution generation, and feelings of frustration. Summative content analyses of the COVID-19 Strategic Support team's replies demonstrated 6 main answer types: explaining procedures, identifying resources, explaining rationales, human resource explanations, sharing employee feedback with relevant parties, and creating practice tools. IMPLICATIONS: The online forum tool was developed and implemented early in the pandemic response to provide key insights into OPH's public health workforce needs and well-being throughout the COVID-19 response. The forum encouraged open dialogue and provided opportunities to establish clarity in a time of rapid situational change.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

This is characterised by distressing 'suspended waiting', a despairing frozen temporality. After this, this odd covid-time is semiotically assimilated into the old and familiar. Distressing 'suspended time' is transformed into 'productive time', 'normal time', and 'transformational time' as an attempt to regulate affect.

METHODS: Outpatients with T2D who had an appointment scheduled during the social distancing period were eligible for telemonitoring. Clinical and laboratorial data were collected from medical records in the last consultation before and from the first visit after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. RESULTS: From the 1241 eligible patients, 816 (65.7%) could be contacted by phone, 137 (11%) attended the unit for consultation during the social distancing period, and 1040 (83.8%) returned up to 12 months after the end of the lockdown period. We observed a meaningful reduction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (7.9 [7-9] vs. 7.7 [6.9-8.8] p = 0.004) and no difference in body mass index (29.5 [26-33.7] vs. 29.6 [26.2-34.1], p = 0.17) before and after the social distancing period. According to insulin use at baseline, the HbA1c variation was +0.6 (-0.7 to +2) and -0.6 (-2.1 to +0.7) in patients without and with insulin, respectively (p < 0.001). In the multivariate model, insulin therapy was the only independent significant predictor of HbA1c reduction. CONCLUSION: This study observed an improvement in glycemic control after the lockdown. The only independent predictor found was previous insulin use.

The main proteins for viral entry into host cells are SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB) and spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 (spike RBD-ACE2; PDB ID: 6M0J). Currently, specific therapies are lacking globally. This study was designed to investigate the bioactive components from Moringa oleifera leaf (MOL) extract by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and their binding interactions with spike glycoprotein and spike RBD-ACE2 protein through computational analysis. GC-MS-based analysis unveiled the presence of thirty-seven bioactive components in MOL extract, viz. polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes/triterpenes, phytosterols/steroids, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. These bioactive phytoconstituents showed potential binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and spike RBD-ACE2 protein through the AutoDock 4.2 tool. Further by using AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDock Vina, the top sixteen hits (binding energy >/= - 6.0 kcal/mol) were selected, and these might be considered as active biomolecules. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation was determined by the Desmond module. Interestingly two biomolecules, namely beta-tocopherol with spike glycoprotein and beta-sitosterol with spike RBD-ACE2, displayed the best interacting complexes and low deviations during 100-ns simulation, implying their strong stability and compactness. Remarkably, both beta-tocopherol and beta-sitosterol also showed the drug- likeness with no predicted toxicity. In conclusion, these findings suggested that both compounds beta-tocopherol and beta-sitosterol may be developed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. The current findings of in silico approach need to be optimized using in vitro and clinical studies to prove the effectiveness of phytomolecules against SARS-CoV-2.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Saudi Arabia was significantly impacted by COVID-19. In March 2021, 381,000 cases were reported with 6539 deaths. This study attempts to quantify the impact of remdesivir on healthcare costs in Saudi Arabia, in terms of intensive care unit admissions, mechanical ventilation, and death prevention. METHODS: A forecasting model was designed to estimate the impact of remdesivir on the capacity of intensive care units and healthcare costs with patients requiring low flow oxygen therapy. The forecasting model was applied in the Saudi context with a 20-week projection between 1 February and 14 June, 2021. Model inputs were collected from published global and Saudi literature, available forecasting resources, and expert opinions. Three scenarios were assumed: the effective pandemic infection rate (Rt) remains at 1, the Rt increases up to 1.2, and the Rt declines from 1 to 0.8 over the study period. RESULTS: The model estimated that the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, in the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, could prevent between 1520 and 3549 patient transfers to intensive care units and mechanical ventilation, prevent between 815 and 1582 deaths, and make potential cost savings between $US154 million and $US377 million owing to the reduction in intensive care unit capacity, respectively.

[doi]", "AB": "In Italy, where neonatal jaundice treatment is required, it is largely carried out in hospitals. However, it is possible to safely administer home phototherapy (HPT). We report our pilot center's experience of HPT and its potential benefits during the COVID-19-enforced national lockdown. This is an observational study performed at the Policlinic Abano Terme, a suburban hospital that covers a large catchment area near the Euganean Hills in Northeast Italy with around 1000 deliveries per year. HPT was started after regular nursery discharge, and the mothers brought the neonates back to the hospital maternity ward each day to check infants' bilirubin levels, weight, and general state of health, until it was deemed safe to stop. The efficacy of HPT in bilirubin reduction, hospital readmission rates, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Thirty infants received HPT. In 4 of these infants, HPT was associated with total serum bilirubin (TSB) between 75 and 95(th) percentile (high-intermediate-risk zone) and in 26 infants HPT was associated with TSB > 95(th) percentile (high-risk zone) of the Bhutani nomogram. Among these 30 infants, 27 (90%) completed the HPT with a progressive decrease of TSB levels with 4 neonates requiring a second course and 3 infants requiring a third course of 24-h HPT. Three (10%) neonates failed HPT and were readmitted after one 24-h phototherapy course. No abnormalities of breastfeeding, body weight (defined as > 10% decrease), temperature, nor COVID infections were detected following HPT consultation in the neonatal ward. Home treatment efficacy with varying degrees of parental satisfaction occurred in all but 3 cases that involved difficulties with the equipment and inconsistent lamp manipulation practices. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study suggests that HPT for neonatal jaundice can be carried out effectively and with parental satisfaction as supported by daily back bilirubin monitoring in the maternity ward during the enforced COVID-19 national lockdown in Italy. WHAT IS KNOWN: * No high-quality evidence is currently available to support or refute the practice of phototherapy in patients' own homes. WHAT IS NEW: * Phototherapy can be delivered at home in a select group of infants and could be an ideal option if parents are able to return with their infants to the hospital maternity ward for daily follow-up. * It can be as effective as inpatient phototherapy and potentially helps in delivering family-centered care.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

METHODS: We analyzed 5% Medicare claims data at aggregate, state, hospital, and encounter levels using MS-DRG (Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group) codes for ECMO, combining state-level data with national census data. Necessity and sufficiency relations associated with change in mortality between the 2 years were modeled using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Multilevel, generalized linear modeling was used to evaluate mortality trends. RESULTS: Based on state-level data, there was a 3.36% increase in mortality between 2019 and 2020. Necessity and sufficiency evaluation of aggregate data at state and institutional levels did not identify any association or combinations of risk factors associated with this increase in mortality. However, multilevel and generalized linear models using disaggregated patient-level data to evaluate institution mortality and patient death, identified statistically significant differences between the first (p = .019) and second (p = .02) months of the 2 years, the first and second quarters (p < .001 and p = .042, respectively), and the first 6 months (p < .001) of 2019 and 2020.

Telemedicine guidelines and flexibilities introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to increase patient access to buprenorphine. However, it is not known whether Americans without access to buprenorphine waivered provider, especially those residing in rural counties, have sufficient broadband internet access to support telemedicine. METHODS: Administrative data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Buprenorphine Treatment Practitioner Locator Tool and the Fixed Broadband Deployment Data from the Federal Communications Commission are utilized to identify counties with low broadband penetration rate and the number of buprenorphine waivered providers with capacity to accept patients within a 30 miles radius. FINDINGS: 23.9% of the US population does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with a capacity to accept new patients within a 30 miles radius. In counties with low broadband penetration rate, 78.9% of residents does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with patient capacity. In rural counties with low broadband penetration rate, 82.3% of the residents does not have access to any buprenorphine waivered provider with patient capacity within a 30 miles radius. CONCLUSIONS: Federal policy initiatives are expected to continue the COVID-19-related telehealth flexibilities and to increase the number of providers available to prescribe buprenorphine, but for that to translate into more patients utilizing treatment via telemedicine, high-speed internet access will be essential. This is particularly salient for residents in rural counties where access to both buprenorphine providers and high-speed internet access is limited.", "CI": ["Published 2022.

It is not fully understood how the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and cellular immunity induced by infection and/or upon vaccination is affected by immunosuppressants. Methods: The dynamics of cellular immune reactivation upon vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 experienced MS patients treated with the humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab (OCR) and RA patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy were analyzed at great depth via high-dimensional flow cytometry of whole blood samples upon vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Longitudinal B and T cell immune responses were compared to SARS-CoV-2 experienced healthy controls (HC) before and 7-days after the first and second vaccination. Results: OCR-treated MS patients exhibit a preserved recall response of CD8(+) T central memory cells following first vaccination compared to healthy controls and a similar CD4(+) circulating T follicular helper 1 and T helper 1 dynamics, whereas humoral and B cell responses were strongly impaired resulting in absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immunity. MTX treatment significantly delayed antibody levels and B reactivation following the first vaccination, including sustained inhibition of overall reactivation marker dynamics of the responding CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Conclusion: Together, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 experienced MS-OCR patients still benefit from vaccination by inducing a broad CD8(+) T cell response which can contribute to milder disease outcome. A delayed dynamics of vaccine-induced immunological recall in RA-MTX patients support repeated vaccine strategies to protect against future variants of concern, especially for these patients.

Excessive cytokine release during COVID-19 is related to increased morbidity and mortality. Several mechanisms are put forward for cytokine release syndrome during COVID-19. Here we would mention a novel pathways. SARS-CoV-2 increases angiotensin II levels by rendering ACE2 nonfunctional. Angiotensin II causes cytokine release via AT1 and AT2 receptors. Moreover, angiotensin II potently stimulates the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). It is a pump found in the membranes of many cells that pumps Na+ inward and H+ outward. NHE has nine isoforms. NHE1 is the most common isoform found in endothelial cells and many cells. NHE is involved in keeping the intracellular pH within physiological limits. When the intracellular pH is acidic, NHE is activated, bringing the intracellular pH to physiological levels, then its activity ends. Sustained NHE activity is highly pathological and causes many problems. Prolonged NHE activation in COVID-19 may cause a decrease in intracellular pH through H+ ion accumulation in the extracellular area and subsequent redox reactions. The activation reduces the intracellular K+ concentration and leads to Na+ and Ca2+ overload. Increased ROS can cause intense cytokine release by stimulating NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Cytokines also cause overstimulation of NHE. As the intracellular pH decreases, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly infects new cells, increasing the viral load. This vicious circle increases morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 interaction with NHE3 in intestinal tissue is different from other tissues. SARS-CoV-2 can trigger CRS via NHE3 inhibition by disrupting the intestinal microbiota. This review aimed to help develop new treatment models against SARS-CoV-2-induced CRS by revealing the possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the NHE.", "CI": ["Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at", "epub@benthamscience.net."], "FAU": ["Cure, Medine Cumhur", "Cure, Erkan"], "AU": ["Cure MC", "Cure E"], "AD": ["Department of Biochemistry, Private Tanfer Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.", "Department of Internal Medicine, Bagcilar Medilife Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United Arab Emirates", "TA": "Curr Pharm Des", "JT": "Current pharmaceutical design", "JID": "9602487", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Angiotensin II", "COVID-19", "Na+/H+ exchanger", "SARS-CoV-2", "cytokine release syndrome", "intracellular pH", "sodium-hydrogen antiporter."], "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 07:53"], "PHST": ["2022/03/03 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/10 00:00 [revised]", "2022/06/28 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/15 07:53 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["CPD-EPUB-125066 [pii]", "10.2174/1381612828666220713121741 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Curr Pharm Des. 2022 Jul 13. pii: CPD-EPUB-125066. doi: 10.2174/1381612828666220713121741."}, {"PMID": "35838210", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220715", "IS": "1873-4286 (Electronic) 1381-6128 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "Therapeutic potential of P2X7 purinergic receptor modulation in the main organs affected by the COVID-19 cytokine storm.", "LID": "10.2174/1381612828666220713115906 [doi]", "AB": "Defined by the World Health Organization as a global public health pandemic, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has a global impact and the death of thousands of people.

After global public health emergency of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing illness of COVID-19 was changing frequency of wearing a mask. Therefore, study was undertaken to assess whether the use of protective masks affects the level of oxygen saturation during rest and during exercise. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The test consisted of a non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation by percutaneous determination of arterial oxygen saturation with the use of the pulse oximeter. Oxygen saturation was measured during rest and after physical exertion performed without a protective mask (2 types of masks were used: surgical and FFP2), as well as during rest and after physical exertion performed with the use of a protective mask. The analysis of the oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate included data on 48 subjects. RESULTS: Comparing the post-exercise and pre-exercise values showed a significant difference between all of them.

Among inpatients at the Department of Urology receiving chemotherapy, we compared the incidence of FN between 317 cases in 2018-2019 and 276 cases in 2020. We retrospectively analyzed the factors of FN via binominal logistic regression analysis based on patient characteristics and the characteristics of primary diseases, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. FN occurred in 20/317 cases in 2018-2019, but only in 1/276 cases in 2020, with a significant decrease in the latter (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, we identified the following independent risk factors for FN: non-COVID-19 era (p = 0.005), first course of therapy (p = 0.005), malnutrition (p = 0.032), and past history of FN (p = 0.018). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hygiene policies for healthcare workers and quarantine measures for patients were thoroughly implemented. As a result, the incidence of FN in 2020 decreased to 1/15 of the previous incidence.

AIM: To demonstrate our experience with regard to implementation of technical and architectural infrastructure for a near real-time electronic health record-based surveillance system for COVID-19 in Iran. METHOD: This COVID-19 surveillance system was developed from hospital information and electronic health record (EHR) systems available in the study hospitals in conjunction with a set of open-source solutions; and designed to integrate data from multiple resources to provide near real-time access to COVID-19 patients' data, as well as a pool of health data for analytical and decision-making purposes. OUTCOMES: Using this surveillance system, we were able to monitor confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in our population and to automatically notify stakeholders. Based on aggregated data collected, this surveillance system was able to facilitate many activities, such as resource allocation for hospitals, including managing bed allocations, providing and distributing equipment and funding, and setting up isolation centres. CONCLUSION: Electronic health record systems and an integrated data analytics infrastructure are effective tools to enable policymakers to make better decisions, and for epidemiologists to conduct improved analyses regarding COVID-19.

First, the gender gap in total parenting time narrowed by 18%. Meanwhile, the gender disparity in time in educational activities increased by 113% and was not explained by changes in mothers' labor force participation. Mothers also took on 20% more time in secondary caregiving compared to fathers. Estimates among working parents indicated that the amount of time in which mothers coupled paid work with caregiving increased by 346% compared to fathers.

Given the fast-tracking of the novel vaccine, its short- and long-term medical implications remain largely to-be-determined in most patient populations. This study aims to analyze 90-day post-operative outcomes in microsurgical patients, who have received or not received SARS-CoV-2-vaccination, using a continuously updated federated electronic medical record network (TriNetX Inc, Cambridge, MA). METHODS: After screening 70 million de-identified records, 16,799 microsurgery patients aged 18-99 meeting medical coding criteria were allocated into two cohorts. Cohort One received SARS-CoV-2-vaccination prior to undergoing microsurgery whereas Cohort Two did not. Two equally sized cohorts, totaling 818 patients were created after propensity score matching for characteristics including: age, race, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Postoperative outcomes within 30-, 60-, and 90-days of microsurgery were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients who were SARS-CoV-2-immunized experienced significantly lower (p < .01) surgical site infections (Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)[95%CI]) = (3.79%-5.36% [0.84-8.54]) ICU admission (9.47%-9.82%[5.45-13.88]), generalized infections (7.68%-9.92%[3.15-14.64]), and hospitalizations (28.48%-32.57%[20.99-40.13]) within 30-, 60-, and 90-days of microsurgery. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated patients also experienced significantly less flap failure (2.49%[0.97-4.02]) and death (2.46%[0.96-3.97]) within 30- and 60-days post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Our analysis examines the potential protective effect of SARS-CoV-2-vaccination in microsurgical patients. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this analysis and the inherent reliance on medical coding.

Furthermore, the study aimed to explore therapists' experience of therapeutic boundaries when working remotely and how they managed these. METHOD: A mixed-method sequential explanatory design was adopted. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse quantitative data, with thematic analysis used to analyse qualitative data. RESULTS: In total, 161 psychological therapists completed an online survey, and 12 participants were selected using maximum variation sampling to engage in a semi-structured interview. Although results between therapists varied, some perceived abilities regarding the working alliance and therapeutic boundaries differed when working remotely compared to face-to-face therapy. Therapists' work involvement patterns also differed compared to existing data for face-to-face therapy, indicated by increased rates of stressful involvement. Considering therapists' experience of therapeutic boundaries, four overarching themes were identified: 'different boundaries in remote therapy', 'work home boundary', 'changes in the therapeutic safe space' and 'impact of boundaries when working remotely'. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects of the working alliance and therapeutic boundaries are experienced differently by therapists working remotely, which relates to how they experience their work. The findings have clinical implications for increasing therapists' awareness of potential changes in their perceived abilities regarding the working alliance and therapeutic boundaries when working remotely, therefore, enabling them to address these changes where required.

Carers looking after a person with dementia have long lamented the absence of an empowered named support and an effectively actioned care plan. Drawing on literary writing and social research, we argue in this article that these challenges have existed since dementia emerged as a major condition in the West during the 1980s. Based on this historical context, we ask: Why has this issue persisted over the last four decades? How have healthcare politics and policy initiatives responded to these requests? And what can we learn from this for the current, COVID-19 exacerbated crisis of care? This article focuses on the English context, to discuss these ongoing challenges in the light of a series of policy papers, and to ask what is hampering the implementation of such policy initiatives. In England, local authorities are responsible for dementia support. This article focuses on the situation in a county in the Midlands where one of us (AB) has been lobbying local government for over a decade. The discussion contextualises the lived experience of dementia care within the situation exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuing politics of crises and persistent emphasis on cure over care. We find that the absence on two points centrally challenges care: a joined-up approach between health and social care and adequate information on available care support services, accessible through an empowered named contact. To enhance the lived experience of dementia care, consistent provision of individual named support and professional care support, as and when required, should become essential to local implementation of the care policy.", "FAU": ["Britton, Anthony", "Zimmermann, Martina"], "AU": ["Britton A", "Zimmermann M"], "AD": ["Founder Trustee, The Pam Britton Trust for Dementia, Leamington Spa, UK.", "UKRI Future Leaders Fellow and Lecturer, Health Humanities and Health Sciences, Department of English, 4616King's College London, London, UK."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4274-6145"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "England", "TA": "Dementia (London)", "JT": "Dementia (London, England)", "JID": "101128698", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Department of Health and Social Care", "dementia", "health care", "local authorities", "policy", "spouse"], "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 06:43"], "PHST": ["2022/07/15 06:43 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1177/14713012221112234 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Dementia (London). 2022 Jul 15:14713012221112234. doi: 10.1177/14713012221112234."}, {"PMID": "35838111", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220715", "IS": "1096-9071 (Electronic) 0146-6615 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 15", "TI": "Comparison of the respiratory tract microbiome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.", "LID": "10.1002/jmv.28002 [doi]", "AB": "Little is known about the characteristics of respiratory tract microbiome in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients with different severity. We conducted a study that expected to clarify these characteristics as much as possible. A cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize respiratory tract microbial communities of 69 COVID-19 inpatients from 64 nasopharyngeal swabs and 5 sputum specimens using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. The bacterial profiles were analyzed to find potential biomarkers by the two-step method, the combination of random forest model and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and explore the connections with clinical characteristics by Spearman's rank test. Compared with mild COVID-19 patients, severe patients had significantly decreased bacterial diversity (P values were less than 0.05 in the alpha and beta diversity) and relative lower abundance of opportunistic pathogens, including Actinomyces, Prevotella, Rothia, Streptococcus, Veillonella. Eight potential biomarkers including Treponema, Leptotrichia, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Parvimonas, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Gemella and Streptococcus were found to distinguish the mild COVID-19 patients from the severe COVID-19 patients. The genera of Actinomyces and Prevotella were negatively correlated with age in two groups. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, neutrophil count (GRA) and lymphocyte count (LYMPH) were significantly correlated with different genera in the two groups. In addition, there were a positive correlation between Klebsiella and white blood cell count (WBC) in two groups. The respiratory tract microbiome had significant differences in COVID-19 patients with different severity.

CAR-T cell recipients have immunosuppression generated by B-cell aplasia leading to a higher susceptibility to respiratory virus infections and poor response to vaccination. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the challenge posed by B-cell targeted immunotherapies: managing long-lasting B-cell impairment during the successive surges of a deadly viral pandemic. We restricted this report to data regarding vaccine efficacy in CAR-T cell recipients, outcomes after developing COVID-19 and specificities of treatment management. We searched in MEDLINE database to identify relevant studies until March 31(st) 2022. EXPERT OPINION: Among available observational studies, the pooled mortality rate reached 40% in CAR-T cell recipients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, vaccines responses seem to be widely impaired in recipients (seroconversion 20%, T-cell response 50%).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgery shortly after Covid-19 infection is associated with higher rates of complications, leading to recommendations to delay surgery following Covid-19 infection when possible. However, prior studies were based on populations with low or no prevalence of vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent scheduled surgery in a health system from January 1, 2018 to February 28, 2022 (N=228,913) was performed. Patients were grouped by time of surgery relative to Covid-19 test positivity: 0 to 4 weeks after Covid-19 (\"Early Post-Covid-19\"), 4 to 8 weeks after Covid-19 (\"Mid Post-Covid-19\"), greater than 8 weeks after Covid-19 (\"Late Post-Covid-19\"), surgery at least 30 days before subsequent Covid-19 (\"Pre-Covid-19\"), and surgery with no prior or subsequent test positivity for Covid-19. RESULTS: Among patients who were not fully vaccinated at the time of Covid-19 infection, the adjusted rate of perioperative complications for the Early Post-Covid-19 group was significantly higher than for the Pre-Covid-19 group (relative risk 1.55; P=0.05). No significantly higher risk was identified between these groups for patients who were fully vaccinated (0.66; P=1.00), or for patients who were not fully vaccinated and underwent surgery without general anesthesia (0.52; P=0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery shortly following Covid-19 infection was not associated with higher risks among fully vaccinated patients or among patients who underwent surgery without general anesthesia. Further research will be valuable to understand additional factors that modify perioperative risks associated with prior Covid-19 infection.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We sought to determine what the safest time would be for COVID-19 diagnosed patients to undergo major operative interventions. METHODS: High-risk operations, between January 2020 and May 2021, were identified from the Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were used to exact match COVID-19 positive cases (n=938) to negative controls (n=7,235). Time effects were calculated as a continuous variable and then grouped into two-week intervals. The primary outcome was 90-day, all-cause postoperative mortality. RESULTS: 90-day mortality in cases and controls was similar when the operation was performed within 9 weeks or longer after a positive test; but significantly higher in cases vs. controls when the operation was performed within 7-8 weeks (12.3% vs. 4.9%), 5-6 weeks (10.3 vs. 3.3%), 3-4 weeks (19.6 vs. 6.7%), and 1-2 weeks (24.7 vs. 7.4%) from diagnosis. Among patients who underwent surgery within 8 weeks from diagnosis, 90-day mortality was 16.6% for cases vs. 5.8% for the controls (P<0.001). In this cohort, we assessed interaction between case status and any symptom (P=0.93), and case status and either respiratory symptoms or fever (P=0.29), neither of which were significant statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing major operations within 8 weeks after a positive test have substantially higher postoperative 90-day mortality than CPT-matched controls without a COVID-19 diagnosis, regardless of presenting symptoms.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Triaging of patients into severe and non-severe could further help in targeted management. \"Potential severe patients\" is a category of patients who did not have severe symptoms at their initial diagnosis, but eventually progressed to be severe patients and are easily overlooked in the early stage. This work aimed to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics signature for the prediction of these potential severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 150 COVID-19 patients were enrolled and randomly divided into cross-validation and independent test sets. First, Their clinical characteristics were screened using the univariate and multivariate logistic regression step by step. Then, radiomics features were extracted from the lesions on their chest CT images. Subsequently, the Inter- and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) analysis, minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) selection and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used step by step for feature selection and construction of a radiomics signature. Finally, the screened clinical risk factors and constructed radiomics signature were combined for the Combined model and Radiomics+Clinics nomogram construction. The predictive performance of the Radiomics and Combined models were evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Delong test. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics analysis resulted in the screening of five clinical risk factors. The combination of ICC, mRMR and LASSO methods resulted in the selection of ten radiomics features, which made up the radiomics signature. The differences in the radiomics signature between the potential severe and non-severe groups in cross-validation set and test sets were both p < 0.001. All Radiomics and Combined models showed a very good predictive performance with the accuracy and AUC of nearly or above 0.9. Additionally, we found no significant difference in the predictive performance between these two models. CONCLUSIONS: A CT-based radiomics signature for the prediction of potential severe COVID-19 patients was constructed and evaluated. Constructed Radiomics and Combined model showed good feasibility and accuracy.

We wished to determine the major factors associated with transmission of COVID-19 within dialysis centres. METHODS: We compared the differences in the number of COVID-19 infections in patients and staff in 5 dialysis centres during the 1(st) COVID-19 pandemic between March and June 2020, and analysed differences between centres. Isolation policies and infection control practices were identical between centres. RESULTS: 224 (30.3%) patients tested positive for COVID-19, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, ranging from 4.8% (centre 1 size 55 patients) to 41.5% (centre 5-248 patients) p=0.007. Communal transport had a significant effect; with 160 of 452 (35.4%) patients using communal testing positive compared to 22.2% of those not using communal transport (X214.5, p<0.001). Staff sickness varied; 35 of 36 (97.3% centre 5) dialysis staff contracting COVID-19, compared to 60% from centre 4 (189 patients 30 staff) (p<0.001). Whereas centre 5 had no natural ventilation, and fan assisted ventilation did not meet standards for air changes and air circulation, centre 4 met ventilation standards. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are many potential risk factors accounting for the increased risk of COVID-19 infection in haemodialysis patients, we found that differences in communal transport for patients and ventilation between centres was a major contributor accounting for the differences in patients testing positive for COVID-19 and staff sickness rates. This has important practical applications for designing kidney dialysis centres.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated for ALL who had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. All patients had antibodies against pegaspargase assayed during ALL therapy prospectively and in response to clinical allergies. Symptoms of intolerance to vaccination were gathered retrospectively from chart abstraction. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was well tolerated in all 78 patients with prior exposure to pegaspargase as part of their leukemia therapy. No reactions were observed in the 54 patients without a history of anti-pegaspargase antibodies or in 19 patients with antibodies who received mRNA vaccination. 1 patient who received the polysorbate containing Janssen vaccine experienced mild symptoms after vaccination not meeting the criteria of clinical allergy which spontaneously resolved within 25 minutes.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Caregiver Support Intervention (CSI), which emphasizes caregiver wellbeing together with training in positive parenting. METHODS: We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial of the CSI with Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an intent-to-treat design, from September 2019-December 2020. A total of 480 caregivers from 240 families were randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group (1:1). Retention from baseline to endline was 93%. Data on parenting and caregiver psychological wellbeing were collected at baseline, endline, and three-month follow-up. Prospective trial registration: ISRCTN22321773. RESULTS: We did not find a significant change on overall parenting skills at endline (primary outcome endpoint) (d = .11, p = .126) or at follow-up (Cohen's d = .15, p = .054). We did find a significant effect on overall parenting skills among participants receiving the full intervention-the sub-sample not interrupted by (COVID-19) (d = 0.25, p < .05). The CSI showed beneficial effects in the full sample at endline and follow-up on harsh parenting (d = -.17, p < .05; d = .19, p < .05), parenting knowledge (d = .63, p < .001; d = .50, p < .001), and caregiver distress (d = -.33, p < .001; d = .23, p < .01). We found no effects on parental warmth and responsiveness, psychosocial wellbeing, stress, or stress management. Changes in caregiver wellbeing partially mediated the impact of the CSI on harsh parenting, accounting for 37% of the reduction in harsh parenting. CONCLUSIONS: The CSI reduced harsh parenting and caregiver distress, and demonstrated the value of addressing caregiver wellbeing as a pathway to strengthening parenting in adversity. These effects were achieved despite a pandemic-related lockdown that impacted implementation, a severe economic crisis, and widespread social unrest.

However, the debate regarding the possible role of infection in causing GBS is still ongoing. This multicenter study aimed to evaluate epidemiological and clinical findings of GBS diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic in North-Eastern Italy in order to further investigate the possible association between GBS and COVID-19. METHODS: GBS cases diagnosed in 14 referral hospitals from Northern Italy between March 2020 and March 2021 were collected and divided into COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative. As a control population, GBS patients diagnosed from January 2019 to February 2020 in the same hospitals were considered. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of GBS in 2020 was 1.41 cases per 100.000 person/year (95% C.I. 1.18-1.68) versus 0.89 cases per 100.000 person/year (95% C.I. 0.71-1.11) in 2019. The cumulative incidence of GBS increased by 59% in the period March 2020-March 2021 and, most importantly, COVID-19 positive GBS patients represented about 50% of the total GBS cases with most of them occurring during the two first pandemic waves in spring and autumn 2020. COVID-19-negative GBS cases from March 2020 to March 2021 declined by 22% compared to February 2019-February 2020.

An experimental approach to the problem will not always be appropriate. An alternative route are observational studies, whether based on regional health service data or hospital records. In this paper, we discuss the use of methods of causal inference for the analysis of such data, with special reference to causal questions that may arise in a pandemic. We apply the methods by using the aid of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the problem, to encode our causal assumptions and to logically connect the scientific questions. We illustrate the usefulness of DAGs in the context of a controversy over the effects of renin aldosterone system inhibitors (RASIs) in hypertensive individuals at risk of (or affected by) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease. We consider questions concerning the existence and the directions of those effects, their underlying mechanisms, and the possible dependence of the effects on context variables. This paper describes the cognitive steps that led to a DAG representation of the problem, based on background knowledge and evidence from past studies, and the use of the DAG to analyze our hospital data and assess the interpretive limits of the results. Our study contributed to subverting early opinions about RASIs, by suggesting that these drugs may indeed protect the older hypertensive Covid-19 patients from the consequences of the disease.

The methods are applied to data from people admitted to hospital with COVID-19, to estimate the probability of admission to intensive care unit, the probability of death in hospital for patients before and after intensive care unit admission, the lengths of stay in hospital, and how all these vary with age and gender. One modelling framework is based on defining transition-specific hazard functions for competing risks. A less commonly used framework defines partially-latent subpopulations who will experience each subsequent event, and uses a mixture model to estimate the probability that an individual will experience each event, and the distribution of the time to the event given that it occurs. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two frameworks, in the context of the COVID-19 example. The issues include the interpretation of the model parameters, the computational efficiency of estimating the quantities of interest, implementation in software and assessing goodness of fit. In the example, we find that some groups appear to be at very low risk of some events, in particular intensive care unit admission, and these are best represented by using 'cure-rate' models to define transition-specific hazards.

Little evidence exists to support the efficacy and safety of these blood conservation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Through retrospective analysis, we sought to describe outcomes following implementation of these recommendations in 58 adult sickle cell patients on chronic exchange transfusions. The strategies employed included: relaxing the goal fraction of cells remaining (FCR) to 30%-50%, utilizing depletion exchanges in select patients, and transitioning select patients to monthly simple transfusions. We compared hemoglobin S%, hemoglobin values, and other laboratory parameters, acute care visits, and red blood cell usage during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic to the year prior using Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Of 53 patients who remained on chronic exchanges during the pandemic, use of depletion exchange increased (15%-23%) and FCR increased (34.9 [SD 4.7] vs. 37.6 [SD 4.5], p < .05). These changes resulted in 854 units conserved without clinically significant changes to pre-exchange laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin S%, or number of acute care presentations. In contrast, five patients who transitioned to predominantly simple transfusions, experienced difficulty maintaining hemoglobin S% less than 30 and worsening anemia.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed demographic characteristics, medical data, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram and echocardiographic findings, 24-hour Holter recordings, need for an ICU, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) </=%55 on echocardiography. RESULTS: Sixty-seven children were included in the study. 24-hour Holters were recorded in 61.2% of the patients and 49.2% were normal. On echocardiographic examination, 14.9% of the patients had systolic dysfunction (EF </= 55%). While 32.8% of patients had mild mitral regurgitation, 3% had moderate mitral regurgitation, and 6% had mild aortic regurgitation. There was no statistically significant difference in EF values between the group with arrhythmia in Holter and the group with normal Holter results (p >/= 0.05). B-type natriuretic peptide was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Significant effectivity of the B-type natriuretic peptide value was observed in the differentiation of those with EF </= and > 55%. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was needed for three (4.5%) patients. One patient who died had systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, troponin, and B-type natriuretic peptide were found to be significantly higher in patients with systolic dysfunction. Also, the cut-off value of 1700 pg/ml for B-type natriuretic peptide was significantly effective.

METHODS: Data were drawn from the Census Household Pulse Survey (fielded between April 2020 and February 2021) consisting of community-dwelling American adults (N = 1.5M+). Social capital measures were taken from the 'Social Capital Project' sponsored by the US Congress. We estimated three-level mixed effects models to analyze multiple waves of repeated cross-sectional surveys. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 food insufficiency was significantly negatively associated with SRH and positively associated depression, adjusting for controls including food insufficiency prior to the onset of the pandemic. These relationships were also more pronounced in areas with higher aggregate social capital.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young children with FEPD and their parents. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey: parents of children with FEPD (0-11 years) in the Netherlands completed an online questionnaire (January-April 2021). This questionnaire included 4 demographic questions (including criteria of Pediatric Feeding Disorder (PFD) and/or Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)) and 11 questions related to experienced impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental responses regarding children with FEPD (including PFD and ARFID) were compared to those of healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: In total, 240 children (median age 5.5 years (inter quartile range (IQR) 3.5-7.9); 53.3% female) were included; 129 children with FEPD and 111 HC. Most children with FEPD fulfilled criteria for PFD (n=119; 92.2%) and/or ARFID (n=117; 90.7%). Parents of children with FEPD reported more stress (of their child (p=0.014) and parental stress (p=0.014)), worse eating by the child (p<0.001), more negative relations within the family (p=0.006) and less support from the environment (p=0.001) compared to parents of HC during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the COVID-19 pandemic had great impact on young children with FEPD and their parents, because parents of children with FEPD reported significantly more perceived stress within both the child and parents, more difficult eating behavior of the child, more negative behavior between family members and less support from the environment as compared with HC.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors."], "FAU": ["Krom, Hilde", "van Mameren, Joost", "Remijn, Lianne", "de Nennie, Katinka", "Dumont, Eric", "van der Gaag, Ellen", "van Leeuwen, Marianne C C", "Mulkens, Sandra", "Schakelaar, Chantal", "Kindermann, Angelika"], "AU": ["Krom H", "van Mameren J", "Remijn L", "de Nennie K", "Dumont E", "van der Gaag E", "van Leeuwen MCC", "Mulkens S", "Schakelaar C", "Kindermann A"], "AD": ["Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.", "SeysCentra, Malden, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "University of Amsterdam, Institute of Physics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "HAN University of Applied Sciences, Academy of Health Studies, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "Pediatric Dietetic Practice Katinka de Nennie, Gouda/Zoetermeer, The Netherlands.", "SeysCentra, Malden, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "Maastricht University, Department of Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht, The Netherlands.", "Maastricht University, Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology; School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "Pediatric department Hospital Group Twente, Almelo-Hengelo, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "SeysCentra, Malden, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "Maastricht University, Department of Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht, The Netherlands.", "Maastricht University, Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology; School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands.", "Isa Power, Udenhout, The Netherlands.", "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Emma Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.", "Multidisciplinary advisory board, Patient organization 'Nee-eten', Haarlem, The Netherlands."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr", "JT": "Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition", "JID": "8211545", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/15 00:03"], "PHST": ["2022/07/15 00:03 [entrez]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1097/MPG.0000000000003563 [doi]", "00005176-990000000-00125 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2022 Jul 15. pii: 00005176-990000000-00125. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003563."}, {"PMID": "35836287", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "PubMed-not-MEDLINE", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "2056-5909 (Print) 2056-5909 (Linking)", "VI": "28", "IP": "1", "DP": "2022 Jul 15", "TI": "Self-care of hypertension of older adults during COVID-19 lockdown period: a randomized controlled trial.", "PG": "21", "LID": "10.1186/s40885-022-00204-7 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated chronic diseases and health disparities especially hypertension because it is more common among vulnerable populations such as older adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of a public health nursing intervention plus m-Health applications for hypertension management on enhancing the self-care, systolic and diastolic of blood pressure, and quality of life in older adults during the lockdown period in Jordan. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial design was performed in Jordan. A total of 120 participants were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 40); interventional group (public health nursing interventions plus m.Health applications) and two control groups (m.Health applications alone group and standard care group). RESULTS: After 3 months, the interventional group show significantly decreased in systolic blood pressure - 14 (F = 16.74, P = 0.001), greater improvement in self-care maintenance, monitoring, and confidence (+ 30, + 17.75, + 40.27; P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the two control groups. Greater improvement in role limitations due to physical health and due to emotional problems, pain, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, and social functioning of quality of life (P < 0.05) compared to the standard care group. No statistical significant difference was found in diastolic blood pressure (F = 3.91, P = 0.141), physical functioning (P = 0.613), and general quality of life (P = 0.060). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the adoption of technology with nursing intervention as a method of supporting continuity of self-management of chronic illness during the pandemic, and its potential implications for future delivery of health care, not just in Jordan, but across the world.

In particular, students were physically and mentally affected by the lockdown and the shift from physical person-to-person classrooms to virtual learning (online classes). This increased the prevalence of psychological stress, anxiety, and depression among university students. In this study, we investigated the depression levels in Saudi Arabian university students who were learning virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic and examined its impact on their educational proficiency. METHODS: The study focused on two points: first, examining the depression levels among undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia, by adapting the Zung (Self-Rating Depression Scale) questionnaire. Second, whether there is an association between the levels of depression and various distress factors associated with virtual (online) learning resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on students' educational behaviors. The questionnaire was prepared using a monkey survey and shared online, via email, and on WhatsApp groups, with participants in two universities, a public and private university in the largest city of Saudi Arabia. A total of 157 complete responses were received. Data were analyzed using SPSS-24, the chi-square test, descriptive statistics, and multilinear regression. RESULTS: The results indicated that three-fourths of the university students suffered from different depressive symptoms, half of which had moderate to extreme levels of depression. Our study confirmed that a boring virtual (online) learning method, stress, fear of examinations, and decreased productivity were significantly associated with increased depression. In addition, 75% and 79% of the students suffered from stress and fear of examinations, respectively. About half of the students were associated with increased depression. The outcome also indicated that female students experienced extreme depression, stress, and fear of examinations more than males. CONCLUSION: These findings can inform government agencies and representatives of the importance of making swift, effective decisions to address students' depression levels. It is essential to provide training for students to change their educational experience mindset, which might help decrease \"depression and stress-related growth.\" There is also a need to search for a better virtual teaching delivery method to lessen students' stress and fear of examinations.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Understanding the underlying spatial and temporal dynamics can help orient timely public health policies and optimize the targeting of non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines to the most vulnerable populations, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The review systematically summarises important methodological aspects and specificities of spatial approaches applied to COVID-19 in Africa. METHODS: Thematically selected keywords will be used to search for refereed studies in the following electronic databases PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINHAL, and Coronavirus Research Database from January 2020 to February 2022. Two independent reviewers will screen the title, abstracts, and full texts against predefined eligibility criteria based on the study's characteristics, methodological relevance, and quality. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 procedures will be adhered to during the reporting process. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 modeling remains in its infancy, and research is needed to characterize uncertainty and validate various modeling regimes appropriately.

In some countries, there is an improved understanding of aspects of the national pet dog population, but as yet limited published information is available in Ireland. The current study reviews the utility of existing data to inform our understanding of recent changes to the pet dog population in Ireland, including both biological and organisational processes. RESULTS: Based on national data on dog licencing and microchipping registration, pet dog numbers have remained relatively stable in recent years (ie prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Since 2015, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of dogs managed through dog control centres. Although the completeness of the data are likely variable, there appears to be substantial, and increasing, number of dogs moving from Ireland to other countries, including UK, Sweden, Italy, Germany and Singapore. We also note an increase (albeit much smaller) in the number of dogs being moved into Ireland. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the challenges faced when using existing national data to gain insights into the dog population of Ireland. The linking of existing national databases (individual dog identification, dog licencing, dog control statistics) has the potential to improve both the representativeness and accuracy of information about the Irish pet dog population. In the next phases of our work, we will focus on the work of dog welfare organisations, given both the increased role played by these organisations and the substantial public funding that has been committed in this sector.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious threat to public health and economic stability worldwide. Given the urgency of the situation, researchers are attempting to repurpose existing drugs for treating COVID-19. METHODS: We first established an anti-coronavirus drug screening platform based on the Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) technology and the interaction between the coronavirus spike protein and its host receptor ACE2. Two compound libraries of 2,864 molecules were screened with this platform. Selected candidate compounds were validated by SARS-CoV-2_S pseudotyped lentivirus and ACE2-overexpressing cell system. Molecular docking was used to analyze the interaction between S protein and compounds. RESULTS: We identified three potential anti-coronavirus compounds: tannic acid (TA), TS-1276 (anthraquinone), and TS-984 (9-Methoxycanthin-6-one). Our in vitro validation experiments indicated that TS-984 strongly inhibits the interaction of the coronavirus S protein and the human cell ACE2 receptor. Additionally, tannic acid showed moderate inhibitory effect on the interaction of S protein and ACE2. CONCLUSION: This platform is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and high throughput system, and available for screening large compound libraries. TS-984 is a potent blocker of the interaction between the S-protein and ACE2, which might have the potential to be developed into an effective anti-coronavirus drug.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

"BACKGROUND: Nanovaccines have shown the promising potential in controlling and eradicating the threat of infectious diseases worldwide. There has been a great need in developing a versatile strategy to conveniently construct diverse types of nanovaccines and induce potent immune responses. To that end, it is critical for obtaining a potent self-adjuvant platform to assemble with different types of antigens into nanovaccines. RESULTS: In this study, we identified a new natural polysaccharide from the rhizomes of Bletilla striata (PRBS), and used this polysaccharide as a platform to construct diverse types of nanovaccines with potent self-adjuvant property. In the construction process of SARS-CoV-2 nanovaccine, PRBS molecules and RBD protein antigens were assembled into ~ 300 nm nanoparticles by hydrogen bond. For HIV nanovaccine, hydrophobic effect dominantly drove the co-assembly between PRBS molecules and Env expression plasmid into ~ 350 nm nanospheres. Importantly, PRBS can potently activate the behaviors and functions of multiple immune cells such as macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells. Depending on PRBS-mediated immune activation, these self-adjuvant nanovaccines can elicit significantly stronger antigen-specific antibody and cellular responses in vivo, in comparison with their corresponding traditional vaccine forms. Moreover, we also revealed the construction models of PRBS-based nanovaccines by analyzing multiple assembly parameters such as bond energy, bond length and interaction sites. CONCLUSIONS: PRBS, a newly-identified natural polysaccharide which can co-assemble with different types of antigens and activate multiple critical immune cells, has presented a great potential as a versatile platform to develop potent self-adjuvant nanovaccines.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

We aimed to assess awareness, attitudes, practices, and factors associated with the mHealth app usage among medical students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving medical students at a government university in Sarawak, Malaysia, from February to April 2021. Validated questionnaires were administered to all consenting students. These questionnaires included questions on basic demographic information as well as awareness, attitude toward, and practices with mHealth apps concerned with medical education, health and fitness, and COVID-19 management. RESULTS: Respondents had favorable attitudes toward mHealth apps (medical education [61.8%], health and fitness [76.3%], and COVID-19 management [82.7%]). Respondents' mean attitude scores were four out of five for all three app categories. However, respondents used COVID-19 management apps more frequently (73.5%) than those for medical education (35.7%) and fitness (39.0%). Usage of all three app categories was significantly associated with the respondent's awareness and attitude. Respondents in the top 20% in term of household income and study duration were more likely to use medical education apps. The number of respondents who used COVID-19 apps was higher in the top 20% household income group than in the other income groups. The most common barrier to the use of apps was uncertainty regarding the most suitable apps to choose. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted a discrepancy between awareness of mHealth apps and positive attitudes toward them and their use. Recognition of barriers to using mHealth apps by relevant authorities may be necessary to increase the usage of these apps.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The purpose of this study is to identify salient beliefs associated with voluntary exercise training among firefighters in the pandemic era by comparing outcomes with those from a previous elicitation study, which was carried out before the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 57 firefighters are recruited to participate in an elicitation study. Participants are requested to respond to six open-ended questions related to voluntary exercise training. Content analysis is used to create categories that combine similar factors in each belief. Beliefs mentioned by more than 30% of participants are used for comparison with the results of the previous research. RESULTS: \"Improves my physical ability\" (n = 44) and \"cause injury\" (n = 17) are identified as behavioral beliefs in the present study, whereas \"makes me tired\" and \"takes too much time\" were also elicited in Lee's study. Normative beliefs are \"family members\" (n = 45) and \"colleagues\" (n = 27) and these results are consistent with those in Lee's study. \"Lack of time\" (n = 28), \"exercise facilities\" (n = 19), and \"COVID-19\" (n = 19) are elicited as control beliefs in the present study, whereas \"physical condition\" (n = 21) and \"exercise partners\" (n = 14) were elicited as other control beliefs, and \"COVID-19\" was not mentioned in Lee's study.

One downstream consequence of the pandemic in the USA and Canada was a surge in drug overdoses resulting from public health-restricted access to services and an increasingly toxic unregulated drug supply. This study aimed to describe changes implemented by programs prescribing pharmaceutical alternatives to the drug supply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An environmental scan used surveys and qualitative interviews with service providers across Canada to examine pharmaceutical alternative prescribing practices and programs before and during the pandemic. This study summarized the nature, frequency, and reasons for pandemic-driven service delivery changes using directed content analysis, counts, and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-two of the 103 participating sites reported 1193 unique changes in physical space (368), client protocols (347), program operations (342), ancillary services (127), and staffing (90). Four qualitative themes describing the reasons for these changes emerged, namely (1) decreasing risk of COVID-19 infection; (2) decreasing risk of overdose; (3) prioritizing acute care of COVID-19 patients; and (4) improving client access to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While most changes were aimed at decreasing risk of COVID-19 infection, some were found to be at odds with the measures needed to combat the overdose crisis; others met dual objectives of decreased risk of both overdose and infection. Further research should examine which changes should be kept or reversed once COVID-19-related public health measures are lifted.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In 2021 the Medical Education Innovation and Research Centre at Imperial College London launched a Global Creative Competition as a platform for medical students to reflect on their experiences during the pandemic. METHODS: Six hundred forty-eight creative pieces with written reflections were submitted by medical students from 52 countries. 155 students from 28 countries consented for their entries to be included in this study. The reflections were analysed thematically and independently by three reviewers to explore how the pandemic impacted students' professional identity formation (PIF). RESULTS: The pandemic increased students' awareness of the social and global role of doctors in addressing health inequities. Students felt part of a wider healthcare community and showed greater appreciation towards person-centred care. Students also became more aware of their personal needs, priorities, and the importance of self-care. DISCUSSION: In agreement with Mezirow's theory of transformative learning (2003), the pandemic led students to re-examine pre-existing epistemic and sociocultural assumptions concerning the role of doctors and explore new perspectives of what it means to be a doctor. In accordance with Cheng's theory of coping flexibility (2021), students developed both emotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., arts engagement) and problem-solving strategies (e.g., volunteering), suggesting they were able to adjust psychologically and develop agency. However, students experienced tension between their sense of duty and sense of wellbeing, highlighting the need for medical educators to design into programmes formal support systems where medical students have the space and time they need to reflect on their emergent identities as a doctor. CONCLUSION: Medical educators should encourage students to reflect on their identity formation while encountering disorientating dilemmas. The inclusion of arts and humanities within the medical curriculum is strongly recommended to provide an avenue for students to access and express complex emotions and experiences.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

METHODS: Using data from the quarterly Michigan State of the State survey conducted in May 2020 (n = 1000), we conducted multiple regression analyses to identify factors associated with willingness to participate in COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. RESULTS: Perceived threat of the pandemic to personal health (B = 0.59, p = <.00, Ref = No threat) and general trust in the health system (B = 0.17, p < 0.001), were the strongest positive predictors of willingness to participate in contact tracing. Concern about misinformation was also positively associated with willingness to participate in contact tracing (B = 0.30, p < 0.001; Ref = No concern). Trust in information from public health institutions was positively associated with willingness to participate in contact tracing, although these institutions were not necessarily the main sources of information about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Policy makers can enhance willingness to participate in public health efforts such as contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks by helping the public appreciate the seriousness of the public health threat and communicating trustworthy information through accessible channels.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

To better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19. We also carried out an epidemiological study to find a possible association between the symptoms and comorbidities of these patients with their clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A representative sampling was performed in different cities in the Province of Cordoba. Ten and nine complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing of nasopharyngeal specimens from non-survivors and survivors, respectively. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses revealed multiple introductions of the most common lineages in South America, including B.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.499, and N.3. Fifty-six mutations were identified, with 14% of those in common between the non-survivor and survivor groups. Specific SARS-CoV-2 mutations for survivors constituted 25% whereas for non-survivors they were 41% of the repertoire, indicating partial selectivity. The non-survivors' variants showed higher diversity in 9 genes, with a majority in Nsp3, while the survivors' variants were detected in 5 genes, with a higher incidence in the Spike protein. At least one comorbidity was present in 60% of non-survivor patients and 33% of survivors. Age 75-85 years (p = 0.018) and hospitalization (p = 0.019) were associated with non-survivor patients. Related to the most common symptoms, the prevalence of fever was similar in both groups, while dyspnea was more frequent among non-survivors and cough among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the association of clinical characteristics with the clinical outcomes of survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 patients, and the specific mutations found in the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in each patient group. Future research on the functional characterization of novel mutations should be performed to understand the role of these variations in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and COVID-19 disease outcomes. These results add new genomic data to better understand the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that spread in Argentina during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Globalization necesitates greater international cooperation among sentinel networks. The aim of this study was to inventory GP sentinel networks involved in epidemiological surveillance on a global scale. METHODS: GP sentinel surveillance networks were inventoried globally between July 2016 and December 2019. Each identified network was required to fill out an electronic descriptive survey for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 148 networks were identified as potential surveillance networks in general practice and were contacted. Among them, 48 were included in the study. Geographically, 33 networks (68.8%) were located in Europe and 38 (79.2%) had national coverage. The number of GPs registered in these networks represented between 0.1 and 100% of the total number of GPs in the network's country or region, with a median of 2.5%. All networks were involved in continuous epidemiologic surveillance and 47 (97.9%) monitored influenza-like illness. Data collection methods were paper-based forms (n = 26, 55.3%), electronic forms on a dedicated website (n = 18, 38.3%), electronic forms on a dedicated software program (n = 14, 29.8%), and direct extraction from electronic medical records (n = 14, 29.8%). Along with this study, a website has been created to share all data collected. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first global geographic mapping of GP sentinel surveillance networks.

ACE2 is expressed on human airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 expression may be associated with potentially high risk of COVID-19. However, the factors responsible for the regulation of ACE2 expression in human airway epithelial cells are unknown. Furthermore, hyperglycemia is a risk factor for poor disease prognosis. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the effects of D-glucose on ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions in Calu-3 bronchial submucosal cells. The cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing different D-glucose concentrations. After 48 and 72 h of high D-glucose (1000 mg/dL) treatment, ACE2 mRNA expressions were significantly increased. ACE2 protein expressions were significantly increased after 24 h of high D-glucose treatment. ACE2 mRNA expression was enhanced by a D-glucose concentration of 550 mg/dL or more after 72 h of treatment. In addition, we investigated the role of glucose transporters (GLUTs) in Calu-3 cells. ACE2 mRNA and protein expressions were suppressed by the GLUT1 inhibitor BAY-876 in high D-glucose-treated Calu-3 cells. GLUT-1 siRNA was also used and ACE2 mRNA expressions were suppressed in high D-glucose-treated Calu-3 cells with GLUT-1 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report indicating that high D-glucose levels induced ACE2 expression via GLUT1 in bronchial submucosal cells in vitro. As hyperglycemia can be treated appropriately, these findings could help reduce the risk of worsening of coronavirus disease 2019.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In such a condition, many fraud products, remedies, and myths have come into the market, which is falsely claimed to be effective for the disease and can harm the patients. Hence, FDA has banned such products and remedies. In this review, we have compiled all such fraudulent and pseudosciences identified for COVID-19.

We investigated whether the combination of viral replication inhibition with remdesivir and administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins with convalescent plasma (CP) therapy might be sufficient to treat B-cell-depleted patients with COVID-19. We enrolled 20 consecutive patients with various HMs with profound B-cell lymphopenia and COVID-19 pneumonia between December 2020 and May 2021. All patients demonstrated undetectable baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels before CP. Each patient received at least a complete course of remdesivir and at least one unit of CP. Previous anti-CD20 therapy resulted in a more prolonged SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity compared to other causes of B-cell lymphopenia (p = 0.004). Timing of CP therapy showed a significant impact on the clinical outcome. Simultaneous use of remdesivir and CP reduced time period for oxygen weaning after diagnosis (p = 0.017), length of hospital stay (p = 0.007), and PCR positivity (p = 0.012) compared to patients who received remdesivir and CP consecutively. In addition, time from the diagnosis to CP therapy affected the length of oxygen dependency (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p < 0.0001). In those cases where there were at least 10 days from the diagnosis to plasma administration, oxygen dependency was prolonged vs. patients with shorter interval (p = 0.006). In conclusion, the combination of inhibition of viral replication with passive immunization was proved to be efficient and safe.

Here we report the development and performance benchmarking of an inexpensive (approximately US$0.30 per test) assay for the rapid (sample-to-answer time within 30 min) colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The assay, which we integrated into foldable paper strips, leverages nucleic acid strand-displacement reactions, the thermodynamic energy penalty associated with single-base-pair mismatches and the metal-ion-controlled enzymatic cleavage of urea to amplify the recognition of viral RNAs for the colorimetric readout of changes in pH via a smartphone. For 50 throat swab samples, the assay simultaneously detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations specific to the SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta and Gamma, with 100% concordance with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing.

chr12q24.13 locus encoding OAS1-OAS3 antiviral proteins has been associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility. Here, we report genetic, functional and clinical insights into this locus in relation to COVID-19 severity. In our analysis of patients of European (n = 2,249) and African (n = 835) ancestries with hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, the risk of hospitalized disease was associated with a common OAS1 haplotype, which was also associated with reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance in a clinical trial with pegIFN-lambda1. Bioinformatic analyses and in vitro studies reveal the functional contribution of two associated OAS1 exonic variants comprising the risk haplotype. Derived human-specific alleles rs10774671-A and rs1131454 -A decrease OAS1 protein abundance through allele-specific regulation of splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We conclude that decreased OAS1 expression due to a common haplotype contributes to COVID-19 severity. Our results provide insight into molecular mechanisms through which early treatment with interferons could accelerate SARS-CoV-2 clearance and mitigate against severe COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

COVID-19 outcomes were identified from the SmiNet database, the National Patient Register and/or Cause-of-Death Register and linked with the National Prescribed Drug Register and sociodemographic registers. Statin exposure was defined as any statin prescriptions in the year before index date. In Cox regressions, confounding was addressed using propensity score ATT (Average Treatment effect in the Treated) weighting. Of 572,695 individuals in the overall cohort, 22.3% had prior statin treatment. After ATT weighting, protective effects were observed among statin user for hospitalization and COVID-19 death in the overall cohort and onset cohort. In the hospitalized cohort, statin use was only associated with lower risk for death (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.95), but not ICU admission.

It is well known that neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines wane within 6 months of vaccination leading to questions on the effectiveness of two-dose vaccination against breakthrough infections. Therefore, we assessed the persistence of immunogenicity up to 6 months after a two or three-dose with BBV152 and the safety of a booster dose in an ongoing phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471519). We report persistence of humoral and cell mediated immunity up to 12 months of vaccination, despite decline in the magnitude of antibody titers. Administration of a third dose of BBV152 increased neutralization titers against both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Delta Plus and Omicron) with a slight increase in B cell memory responses. Thus, seronversion rate remain high in boosted recipients compared to non-booster, even after 6 months, post third dose against variants. No serious adverse events observed, except pain at the injection site, itching and redness. Hence, these results indicate that a booster dose of BBV152 is safe and necessary to ensure persistent immunity to minimize breakthrough infections of COVID-19, due to newly emerging variants.Trial registration: Registered with the Clinical Trials Registry (India) No. CTRI/2021/04/032942, dated 19/04/2021 and on Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04471519.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The objective of our study was to investigate the association of COVID-19 and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFl) in hospitalized patients. This retrospective study used electronic medical records to detect patients with COVID-19 and their comorbidities within the Mass General Brigham hospital system. All patients >/= 18 years who were hospitalized and received a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were screened for inclusion as well as patients from a pre-pandemic cohort. We matched on common risk factors for AF and then used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds for AF or AFl. Of 78,725 patients eligible for analysis, 11,004 COVID-19 negative patients were matched to 3,090 COVID-19 positive patients and 5005 pre-pandemic patients were matched to 2283 COVID-19 positive patients. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, COVID-19 positive patients had 1.19 times the odds (95% CI 1.00, 1.41) of developing AF compared to COVID-19 negative patients and 1.57 times the odds (95% CI 1.23, 2.00) of developing AF compared to pre-pandemic patients. Our study demonstrated an increased risk for AF, directing the attention for improved screening and treatment regimens for the sequelae of COVID-19.

We used a Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model to estimate the daily infection risk. The cities accounted for 11,403 (81.17%) of 14,048 locally confirmed cases. The mean effective reproduction number (Re) surged before the level three alert and peaked on May 16, 2021, the day after the level three alert in Taipei City (Re = 3.66) and New Taipei City (Re = 3.37). Mobility reduction and a lower positive rate were positively associated with a lower number of cases and incidence. In the spatiotemporal view, seven major districts were identified with a radial spreading pattern from one hard-hit district. Villages with a higher inflow degree centrality among people aged >/= 60 years, having confirmed cases, specific land-use types, and with a higher aging index had higher infection risks than other villages.

To examine the causative role of COVID-19 in the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, we estimated their genetic correlation, and then conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19, as well as six major neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. We identified a significant and positive genetic correlation between hospitalization of COVID-19 and AD (genetic correlation: 0.23, P = 8.36E-07). Meanwhile, hospitalization of COVID-19 was significantly associated with a higher risk of AD (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P: 1.19E-03).

During the early stages of the pandemic, the lack of formalized evidence-based guidelines in all aspects of patient management was a significant challenge. Coupled with a lack of effective pharmacotherapies resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes in ICU patients. The anticipated increment in ICU surge capacity was staggering, with almost every ICU worldwide being advised to increase their capacity to allow adequate care provision in response to multiple waves of the pandemic. This increase in surge capacity required advanced planning and reassessments at every stage, taking advantage of experienced gained in combination with emerging evidence. In University Hospital Southampton General Intensive Care Unit (GICU), despite the initial lack of national and international guidance, we enhanced our ICU capacity and developed local guidance on all aspects of care to address the rapid demand from the increasing COVID-19 admissions. The main element of this success was a multidisciplinary team approach intertwined with equipment and infrastructural reorganization. This narrative review provides an insight into the approach adopted by our center to manage patients with COVID-19 critical illness, exploring the initial planning process, including contingency preparations to accommodate (360% capacity increment) and adaptation of our management pathways as more evidence emerged throughout the pandemic to provide the most appropriate levels of care to our patients. We hope our experience will benefit other intensive care units worldwide.

Viral infections need innate and adaptive immune reactions since the various immune components like neutrophils, macrophages, CD4(+) T, CD8(+) T, and B lymphocytes play different roles in various infections. Consequently, the characterization of innate and adaptive immune reactions toward SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to defining the pathogenicity of COVID-19. In this study, we explain what is currently understood concerning the conventional immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2 infection to shed light on the protective and pathogenic role of immune response in this case.

However, there are limited data on how disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) alter SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine immunogenicity in patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: As part of a prospective cohort study, we investigated the induction, stability and boosting of vaccine-specific antibodies, B cells and T cells in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on different DMTs after homologous primary, secondary and booster SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations. Of 126 patients with MS analysed, 105 received either anti-CD20-based B cell depletion (aCD20-BCD), fingolimod, interferon-beta, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide or natalizumab, and 21 were untreated MS patients for comparison. RESULTS: In contrast to all other MS patients, and even after booster, most aCD20-BCD- and fingolimod-treated patients showed no to markedly reduced anti-S1 IgG, serum neutralising activity and a lack of receptor binding domain-specific and S2-specific B cells. Patients receiving fingolimod additionally lacked spike-reactive CD4(+) T cell responses. The duration of fingolimod treatment, rather than peripheral blood B and T cell counts prior to vaccination, determined whether a humoral immune response was elicited. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of immunogenicity under long-term fingolimod treatment demonstrates that functional immune responses require not only immune cells themselves, but also access of these cells to the site of inoculation and their unimpeded movement. The absence of humoral and T cell responses suggests that fingolimod-treated patients with MS are at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections despite booster vaccinations, which is highly relevant for clinical decision-making and adapted protective measures, particularly considering additional recently approved sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor antagonists for MS treatment.", "CI": ["(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: The study included 75 parents who have preschool-aged children with hearing loss. The inclusion criteria were being a family member of a child with hearing loss between the ages of one and six years. The children's mean age was 4.09 (+/- 1.42). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The evaluation forms included the control list to determine how the children with hearing loss and their parents were affected during the pandemic, the Parents' Evaluation of Aural Performance of Children rating scale to measure children's auditory performance, the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire to assess behavior problems, the Preschool Anxiety Scale parental form, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state form to measure the stress level of children and their parents. Parents were asked to fill out all forms. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare before and during the pandemic scores of PEACH and PBQ. Descriptive statistics on the levels of anxiety throughout families and children were presented. The Spearman test was used to examine the relationship between the effect of pandemic and other variables. RESULTS: There was a difference in the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire scores before and during the pandemic but not in the Parents' Evaluation of Aural Performance of Children scores. The PBQ significantly increased during the pandemic, with 49% of children exhibiting out-of-the-ordinary behavior. The mean score of the Preschool Anxiety Scale -Parental form was 26.65+/- 19.05. Among all parents, 66% of them showed high levels of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state. As before- and during-pandemic the Parents' Evaluation of Aural Performance of Children scores decreased, the children and their families were negatively affected during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Parents' perspectives provided information on behavioral changes in children with hearing loss. Even though they did not report any difference in their children's auditory perception performance, long-term effects of limited or no auditory training should be studied.", "CI": ["Thieme.

SUMMARY: Federated learning provides a functional alternative to the single-institution approach while avoiding the pitfalls of data sharing. In cross-silo federated learning, the data do not leave a site. The raw data are stored at the site of collection. Models are created at the site of collection and are updated locally to achieve a learning objective. We demonstrate a use case with COVID-19-associated AKI. We showed that federated models outperformed their local counterparts, even when evaluated on local data in the test dataset, and performance was like those being used for pooled data. Increases in performance at a given hospital were inversely proportional to dataset size at a given hospital, which suggests that hospitals with smaller datasets have significant room for growth with federated learning approaches.

Lung explants may provide a rare insight into terminal SARS-CoV-2-associated lung damage and its pathophysiology. A 62-year-old man presented with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms after recovering from mild COVID-19 3 months earlier. No underlying pulmonary comorbidities were reported. A chest CT revealed bilateral extensive ground-glass and reticular opacities, suspicious of pulmonary fibrosis. Despite initial high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, the interstitial lung disease progressed, and after exhausting all viable therapeutic options, bilateral lung transplantation was successfully conducted. Histological analysis revealed extensive end-stage interstitial fibrosis with diffuse dendriform ossification and bronchiolar and transitional cell metaplasia. Signs of interstitial remodeling such as an increased interstitial collagen deposition, a pathological accumulation of CD163+/CD206+ M2-polarized macrophages with an increased expression of phosphorylated ERK, and an increased density of CD105+ newly formed capillaries were observed. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in the endothelium of medium-sized vessels confirmed a persistence of SARS-CoV-2.

However, interprofessional culinary training remains largely unstudied among professional students who will be involved in collaborative patient care. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an elective interprofessional culinary medicine course for students in the medical, pharmacy, social work, nursing, law, and dentistry schools at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Methods: The interprofessional culinary medicine course was offered in-person at the teaching kitchen of the Nova Institute for Health in 2020 and virtually in 2021 during the COVID pandemic. The training featured five workshops combining instruction in a variety of popular diets, cooking a meal inspired by the diet in focus, and group discussion. Paired t tests were utilized to evaluate changes in pre-/post-training nutrition and interprofessional experience outcomes. Linear regression models were constructed to compare outcomes between in-person and virtual delivery. Results: A total of 62 students participated in the culinary medicine training. Confidence in all nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes, as well as interprofessional experience outcomes, improved after the training (p < 0.05). Similar improvements were noted in most outcomes with in-person and virtual delivery in linear regression modeling.

To assess the progression or regression of respiratory failure in critically ill patients with COVID-19 on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by using LU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed all patients admitted to Internal Intensive Care Unit, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich, from March 2020 to December 2020 suffering lung failure caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). LU was performed according to a standardized protocol at baseline and at follow up every other day for the first 15 days using a lung ultrasound score (LUSS). Ventilation data were collected simultaneously. RESULTS: Our study included 42 patients. At admission to ICU, 19 of them (45%) were mechanically ventilated. Of the non-invasive ventilated ones (n = 23, 55%), eleven patients required invasive ventilation over the course. While LUS did not differ at admission to ICU between the invasive ventilated ones (at baseline or during ICU stay) compared to the non-invasive ventilated ones (12+/-4 vs 11+/-2 points, p = 0.2497), LUS was significantly lower at d7 for those, who had no need for invasive ventilation over the course (13+/-5 vs 7+/-4 points, p = 0.0046). Median time of invasive ventilation counted 18 days; the 90-day mortality was 24% (n = 10) in our cohort. In case of increasing LUS between day 1 (d1) and day 7 (d7), 92% (n = 12/13) required invasive ventilation, while it was 57% (n = 10/17) in case of decreasing LUS. At d7 we found significant correlation between LU and FiO2 (Pearson 0.591; p = 0.033), p/F ratio (Pearson -0.723; p = 0.005), PEEP (Pearson 0.495; p = 0.043), pplat (Pearson 0.617; p = 0.008) and compliance (Pearson -0.572; p = 0.016).

acquire foods. In this paper, we analyze eight food acquisition activities at different points in the pandemic, which allows us to evaluate how food acquisition changed as case rates changed and vaccine rollouts occurred. We collected data from three nationally representative online samples in September 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. We evaluate changes across time and across demographics using a multivariate probit model. Across time, we find that in-person grocery shopping remained extremely common (over 90%) throughout the pandemic. Food acquisition activities with less in-person contact (e.g., ordering from a meal kit service, online grocery shopping) peaked in December 2020, likely due to the surge in cases during that period. Ordering take-out from a restaurant remained common throughout the pandemic, but indoor dining increased significantly in March 2021 when vaccines were becoming more widely available. Food acquisition activities also varied across consumer groups, particularly indoor and outdoor restaurant dining. Overall our results offer evidence that in-person grocery shopping is a staple food acquisition activity that is unlikely to be changed; however, there is a segment of consumers who complement their in-person grocery shopping with online grocery shopping options. Further, relative to grocery stores, restaurants may be more vulnerable to surges in COVID-19 case rates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In February 2021, we conducted a follow-up questionnaire-based survey among adults with mental illness, who responded to a similar survey on mental health in June 2020. The participants completed the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in mental health using the pre-pandemic period as reference. The survey data were merged with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees to the first survey, enabling analysis of attrition and weighting of the results. RESULTS: A total of 613 of 992 (62%) invitees participated in the follow-up wave of the survey. The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 27, respectively, and did not differ statistically significantly from the first wave. Multivariate logistic regression showed that having a vocational education (skilled worker/craftsman) was positively associated with reporting deterioration in psychological well-being (OR: 2.95, 95%CI: 1.14-7.81), while being unemployed was negatively associated with reporting deterioration in psychological well-being (OR: 0.20, 95%CI: 0.07-0.56) from the first to the second survey wave.

Antiphospholipid antibody (APLa) formation is one of the mechanisms. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with thrombosis in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Measure APLa and vitamin D in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without thrombosis to evaluate if thromboembolism is associated with concomitant APLa and vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: Case-control study. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a thromboembolic event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, Cases n = 20). Controls (n = 20): Age, sex-matched without thromboembolic events. Patients with autoimmune disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, thrombophilia, anticoagulation therapy, prior thromboembolism, chronic kidney disease 3b, 4, end-stage renal disease, and malignancy were excluded. Given the limited current literature on the role of concomitant antiphospholipid antibodies and vitamin D deficiency in causing venous and/or arterial thrombosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we enrolled 20 patients in each arm. Anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM, beta-2 glycoprotein-1 IgG/IgM, lupus anticoagulant and vitamin D levels were measured in both groups. RESULTS: Cases were 5.7 times more likely to be vitamin D deficient (OR:5.7, 95% CI:1.3-25.6) and 7.4 times more likely to have any one APLa (OR:7.4, 95% CI: 1.6-49.5) while accounting for the effects of sex.

Unmet need and harm from poor menstrual health in low-and- middle-income countries have been documented, but with little empirical research undertaken in high income countries. Continuing austerity in the UK suggests menstruators are likely more vulnerable to 'period poverty' than previously, with the COVID-19 pandemic assumed to exacerbate the situation. AIM: To explore the menstrual experiences and perceptions of women in the UK who are living under circumstances of deprivation, alongside views of staff working in organisations supporting these women, to understand whether women's menstrual needs are met. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in an inner-city in NW England. Three focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews were conducted across three study sites supporting impoverished women. Data was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Themes were: reflections on menstruation; affordability of products; access to public facilities; organisational support; potential solutions. Many women perceived menstruation as a burden in three aspects: physical discomfort and pain; psychological anxiety; and shame and stigma. Managing menstruation was difficult due to cost relative to low incomes, with food, heating and lighting prioritised, leaving women improvising with materials or wearing products for longer than desired. Most suggested that products should be free, often remarking if men required similar items this would happen. Most women were unaware supporting organisations provided free products. Staff felt the small range of products offered did not meet client needs and were ill-prepared to have conversations on products and clients' menstrual needs. CONCLUSION: Impoverished women lack the necessary resources to manage their menses well which negatively impacts their health and brings stress, embarrassment, and shame. Support, including access to free products, is needed at both local and national level to help impoverished women manage their menstrual hygiene.", "FAU": ["Boyers, Madeleine", "Garikipati, Supriya", "Biggane, Alice", "Douglas, Elizabeth", "Hawkes, Nicola", "Kiely, Ciara", "Giddings, Cheryl", "Kelly, Julie", "Exley, Diane", "Phillips-Howard, Penelope A", "Mason, Linda"], "AU": ["Boyers M", "Garikipati S", "Biggane A", "Douglas E", "Hawkes N", "Kiely C", "Giddings C", "Kelly J", "Exley D", "Phillips-Howard PA", "Mason L"], "AD": ["Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England.", "Liverpool Women's Hospital, Liverpool, England.", "University of Liverpool Management School, Liverpool, England.", "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England.", "The Whitechapel Centre, Liverpool, England.", "South Liverpool Foodbank, Liverpool, England.", "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England.", "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England.", "Adelaide House, Liverpool, England.", "Brownlow Health, Liverpool, England.", "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England.", "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, England."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8576-8227", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-9261"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/epidemiology", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Hygiene", "Male", "*Menstruation/psychology", "Pandemics", "Poverty"], "PMC": "PMC9282460", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 13:43"], "PHST": ["2022/01/04 00:00 [received]", "2022/05/18 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/14 13:43 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0269341 [doi]", "PONE-D-22-00234 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 14;17(7):e0269341. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0269341. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35834501", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220718", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "Clinical, laboratory data and inflammatory biomarkers at baseline as early discharge predictors in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.", "PG": "e0269875", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0269875 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overwhelmed hospital services due to the rapid transmission of the virus and its severity in a high percentage of cases. Having tools to predict which patients can be safely early discharged would help to improve this situation. METHODS: Patients confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection from four Spanish hospitals. Clinical, demographic, laboratory data and plasma samples were collected at admission. The patients were classified into mild and severe/critical groups according to 4-point ordinal categories based on oxygen therapy requirements. Logistic regression models were performed in mild patients with only clinical and routine laboratory parameters and adding plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels to predict both early discharge and worsening. RESULTS: 333 patients were included. At admission, 307 patients were classified as mild patients. Age, oxygen saturation, Lactate Dehydrogenase, D-dimers, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and oral corticosteroids treatment were predictors of early discharge (area under curve (AUC), 0.786; sensitivity (SE) 68.5%; specificity (S), 74.5%; positive predictive value (PPV), 74.4%; and negative predictive value (NPV), 68.9%).

Using flow cytometry, we investigated if the two most abundant viral structural proteins, spike and nucleocapsid, can activate human gammadelta T cell subsets, directly or in the presence of dendritic cells (DC). Both proteins failed to induce interferon-gamma production by Vdelta1 or Vdelta2 T cells within fresh mononuclear cells or lines of expanded gammadelta T cells generated from healthy donors, but the same proteins stimulated CD3+ cells from COVID-19 patients. The nucleocapsid protein stimulated interleukin-12 production by DC and downstream interferon-gamma production by co-cultured Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 T cells, but protease digestion and use of an alternative nucleocapsid preparation indicated that this activity was due to contaminating non-protein material. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins do not have stimulatory activity for DC or gammadelta T cells.

Since intubation is usually decided based on varying clinical conditions, such as required oxygen changes, we aimed to elucidate thresholds of increase in oxygen demand to predict MV use within 12 h. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study using data between January 2020 and January 2021was conducted. Data were retrieved from the hospital data warehouse. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) who needed oxygen during admission were included. Hourly increments in oxygen demand were calculated using two consecutive oxygen values. Covariates were selected from measurements at the closest time points of oxygen data. Prediction of MV use within 12 h by required oxygen changes was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating curves (AUCs). A threshold for increased MV use risk was obtained from restricted cubic spline curves. RESULTS: Among 66 eligible patients, 1835 oxygen data were analyzed. The AUC was 0.756 for predicting MV by oxygen demand changes, 0.888 by both amounts and changes in oxygen, and 0.933 by the model adjusted with respiratory rate, PCR quantification cycle (Ct), and days from PCR. The threshold of increments of required oxygen was identified as 0.44 L/min/h and the probability of MV use linearly increased afterward. In subgroup analyses, the threshold was lower (0.25 L/min/h) when tachypnea or frequent respiratory distress existed, whereas it was higher (1.00 L/min/h) when viral load is low (Ct >/=20 or days from PCR >7 days). CONCLUSIONS: Hourly changes in oxygen demand predicted MV use within 12 h, with a threshold of 0.44 L/min/h.

One-Step Real-Time RT-PCR was employed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from individual nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 10,014 swabs, sampled from the general public (hospital admissions, A&E, elective surgeries, cancer patients, care home residents and healthcare staff), were tested using standard replicate testing. Our analysis demonstrates that approximately 19% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals would have been reported as false negative if single sample Real-Time PCR testing was used. Therefore, two replicate tests can substantially decrease the risk of false negative reporting and reduce hospital and community infection rates. As the number of variants of concern increases, we believe that replicate testing is an essential consideration for effective SARS-CoV-2 infection detection and prevention of further outbreaks. A strategic approach limiting the number of missed infections is crucial in controlling the rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the management of future pandemics.", "FAU": ["Webb, William R", "Thapa, Gauri", "Tirnoveanu, Alice", "Kallu, Sabrina", "Loo Jin Yi, Charlene", "Shah, Nirali", "Macari, Joseph", "Mitchell, Sadie", "Fagg, Graham J", "Jeremiah, Rachael N", "Theminimulle, Sandiya", "Vuono, Romina", "Mylona, Athina"], "AU": ["Webb WR", "Thapa G", "Tirnoveanu A", "Kallu S", "Loo Jin Yi C", "Shah N", "Macari J", "Mitchell S", "Fagg GJ", "Jeremiah RN", "Theminimulle S", "Vuono R", "Mylona A"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2701-626X", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5977-6183"], "AD": ["Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Health and Social Care, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, United Kingdom.", "Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Health and Social Care, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, United Kingdom.", "Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, School of Psychology and Life Sciences, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, United Kingdom.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "North Kent Pathology Service, Microbiology, Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford and Gravesham NHS Foundation Trust, Dartford, England.", "Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Canterbury, England.", "Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Health and Social Care, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, United Kingdom.", "Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, School of Psychology and Life Sciences, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, United Kingdom."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "RN": ["0 (RNA, Viral)", "SARS-CoV-2 variants"], "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/diagnosis/epidemiology", "Humans", "Pandemics/prevention & control", "Pilot Projects", "RNA, Viral/genetics", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "*SARS-CoV-2/genetics"], "PMC": "PMC9282535", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 13:34"], "PHST": ["2021/12/30 00:00 [received]", "2022/05/29 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/14 13:34 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0269883 [doi]", "PONE-D-21-40437 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 14;17(7):e0269883. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0269883. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35834471", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220718", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "Self-reported adaptability among postgraduate dental learners and their instructors: Accelerated change induced by COVID-19.", "PG": "e0270420", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0270420 [doi]", "AB": "It is forecasted that the skills and competencies necessary for post-pandemic success in higher education need to be founded upon adaptability, coping, and Self- Regulated Learning (SRL). It is worth investigating how stakeholders perceived their adaptability and coping with the accelerated change accompanying Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported adaptability of postgraduate dental learners and their instructors in the context of abrupt transition to distance learning induced by the pandemic. This study utilized a convergent mixed methods study design. The quantitative and qualitative data were concurrently collected from instructors and learners, using a tailor-made survey of items measured with a Likert-type scale, complemented with open-ended questions. The collected datasets were independently analyzed. Descriptive and inferential analysis were conducted using the quantitative data. Qualitatively, the researchers underwent a multi-staged thematic analysis. The generated information was then integrated using a joint model analysis. The percentage of the total average of self-reported adaptability for both groups of stakeholders was 81.15%. The instructors, with a mean of satisfaction of 17.94 (+/-1.76), rated their adaptability significantly higher than the learners, with a mean of satisfaction of 15.66 (+/-2.77) (p = 0.002). The thematic analysis resulted in two interrelated themes: Self and Environment. Within the Self theme, three subthemes surfaced: Cognitions, Emotions, and Behaviors. As for the Environment theme, it encapsulated two subthemes: Enablers and Impediments. The stakeholders perceived themselves to have adapted well to the transition, and SRL appeared as a cornerstone in the adaptation to the accelerated change accompanying COVID-19. There appeared to be an interplay between the cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on the level of the self as part of the adaptation process. Also, building upon existent models of SRL, this study uncovered that the stakeholders considered the environment to play a crucial role in their adaptation process. This highlights the importance of developing a climate that remains, despite external pressures, conducive to attaining learning and teaching goals. It is also crucial for university-level mental health promotion activities to proactively foster, among learners and instructors, adaptability, building 'academic resilience'.", "FAU": ["Otaki, Farah", "Amir-Rad, Fatemeh", "Al-Halabi, Manal", "Baqain, Zaid", "Zary, Nabil"], "AU": ["Otaki F", "Amir-Rad F", "Al-Halabi M", "Baqain Z", "Zary N"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8944-4948", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7416-6068", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9482-4614", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8999-6999"], "AD": ["Strategy and Institutional Excellence, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "Masters in Medical Education Programme, Centre for Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Nethergate, Dundee, United Kingdom.", "Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.", "Institute for Excellence in Health Professions Education, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/epidemiology", "Humans", "Learning", "Pandemics", "Self Report"], "PMC": "PMC9282474", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/19 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 13:34"], "PHST": ["2021/05/18 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/09 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/14 13:34 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/19 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0270420 [doi]", "PONE-D-21-16304 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 14;17(7):e0270420. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0270420. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35834442", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220718", "LR": "20220718", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "Feature-level ensemble approach for COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.", "PG": "e0268430", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0268430 [doi]", "AB": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has threatened many human beings around the world and capsized economies at unprecedented magnitudes.

However, identifying and distinguishing COVID-19 from virtually similar thoracic abnormalities utilizing medical images is challenging because it is time-consuming, demanding, and susceptible to human-based errors. Therefore, artificial-intelligence-driven automated diagnoses, which excludes direct human intervention, may potentially be used to achieve consistently accurate performances. In this study, we aimed to (i) obtain a customized dataset composed of a relatively small number of images collected from publicly available datasets; (ii) present the efficient integration of the shallow handcrafted features obtained from local descriptors, radiomics features specialized for medical images, and deep features aggregated from pre-trained deep learning architectures; and (iii) distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and pneumonia patients using a collection of conventional machine learning classifiers. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrated that the feature-based ensemble approach provided the best classification metrics, and this approach explicitly outperformed schemes that used only either local, radiomic, or deep features.

This is achieved by generating a complementary diversity of antibody sequences through somatic recombination and hypermutation. A full understanding of the antibody repertoire in health and disease therefore requires dedicated de novo sequencing methods. Next-generation cDNA sequencing methods have laid the foundation of our current understanding of the antibody repertoire, but these methods share one major limitation in that they target the antibody-producing B-cells, rather than the functional secreted product in bodily fluids. Mass spectrometry-based methods offer an opportunity to bridge this gap between antibody repertoire profiling and bulk serological assays, as they can access antibody sequence information straight from the secreted polypeptide products. In a step to meeting the challenge of mass spectrometry (MS)-based antibody sequencing, we present a fast and simple software tool (Stitch) to map proteomic short reads to user-defined templates with dedicated features for both monoclonal antibody sequencing and profiling of polyclonal antibody repertoires. We demonstrate the use of Stitch by fully reconstructing two monoclonal antibody sequences with >98% accuracy (including I/L assignment); sequencing a Fab from patient serum isolated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) fractionation against a high background of homologous antibody sequences; sequencing antibody light chains from the urine of multiple-myeloma patients; and profiling the IgG repertoire in sera from patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Although recent reports have suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has markedly reduced the incidence of pediatric fractures, no study has specifically evaluated the impact on pediatric elbow fractures. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the incidence, severity, and resource utilization for managing pediatric elbow fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with prepandemic years. METHODS: A prepandemic (2007 to 2017) cohort and a COVID-19 pandemic period (March 2020 to March 2021) cohort of pediatric elbow injuries from a single tertiary hospital were retrospectively examined and compared. Exclusion criteria included outside treatment or lack of diagnosis by an orthopedist. Presentation information, injury patterns, transport, and treatment requirements were collected. RESULTS: Although the incidence of pediatric elbow fractures and rate of neurovascular injury were comparable, seasonal patterns were not sustained and the rate of fracture displacement was found to be significantly elevated in the COVID-19 period compared with nonpandemic years. Likewise, marked changes to where patients first presented (emergency department vs. Clinic), how the patients were transported, and the distance traveled for care were observed. Specifically, patients were more likely to present to the clinic, were more likely to self-transport instead of using emergency medical service transportation, and traveled a greater distance for care, on average. Aligning with these changes, the resources utilized for the treatment of pediatric elbow fracture markedly changed during the COVID-19 period. This study found that there was an increase in the overall number of surgeries performed, the total operative time required to treat elbow fractures, and the number of patients requiring admission during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a contrasting viewpoint to prior reports, illustrating that the incidence of elbow fractures remained consistent during the COVID-19 period, whereas the operative volume and need for hospital admission increased compared with years prior. Furthermore, this study demonstrated how the COVID-19 pandemic altered the interface between pediatric patients with elbow fractures and our institution regarding the location of presentation and transportation.

We also compared posttraumatic growth between the profiles. METHOD: A sample of 640 Italian participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of COVID-19-Related Fears (MAC-RF), the Future Orientation Scale (FOS), the UCLA Loneliness Scale-Version 3, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). RESULTS: Latent profile analysis indicated a 4-class solution as the best-fitting model. The first profile (\"Detached\") comprised 9.9% of the sample and was characterized by both low fear and future orientation. The second profile (\"Hopeful\") concerned 49.9% of the sample and it featured low fear and high future orientation. The third profile (\"Constructively Preoccupied\") involved 35.5% of the sample and was distinguished by high fear and high future orientation. The fourth profile (\"Fearful\") included 4.6% of the sample and was marked by high fear and low future orientation. Multinomial logistic regressions indicated that the female gender was more likely to be associated with the Constructively Preoccupied profile, while older age was more likely to be associated with the Hopeful one. Higher perceived loneliness was associated with all profiles except the Hopeful. Results of comparisons showed substantial differences in posttraumatic growth between the profiles. The Constructively Preoccupied profile showed the greatest posttraumatic growth. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results point out the various profile of reaction to the pandemic and that adopting a person-oriented approach could enhance their grasp.

METHOD: Data were collected online from 990 youth and young adults, aged 13-23 years between November 27, 2020 and December 11, 2020. RESULTS: Participants who had recently been exposed to SDV reported being more impacted by the pandemic and had poorer mental health indicators. Participants with past SDV exposure who engaged in a high number of prosocial activities (e.g., talking with friends) were less likely to report depressive symptoms (beta = -.13, p = .01) than similarly engaged nonexposed participants; the same was true for recently exposed participants (beta = -.14, p = .02).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all reportable cases of COVID-19 who attended a kindergarten-Grade 12 (K-12) school within the study area between January and June of the 2020-2021 school year. The acquisition source was inferred based on epidemiological data and, when available, whole genome sequencing results. Mixed effects logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors independently associated with in-school acquisition of COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 2877 cases of COVID-19 among staff and students were included in the analysis; of those, 9.1% had evidence of in-school acquisition. The median cluster size was two cases (interquartile range: 1). Risk factors for in-school acquisition included being male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.17), being a staff member (aOR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.64-4.21) and attending or working in an independent school (aOR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.13-4.62).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 to October 31, 2020 in febrile patients >/= 10 years in three health facilities in Lome. Finger stick blood was collected to detect Plasmodium spp. using thin/thick smear and venous blood on EDTA tubes to test for malaria Histidin-Rich-Protein-2 antigen using rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M and G. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples was performed by rRT-PCR using GeneXpert. RESULTS: A total of 243 participants (61.7% of female) with median age 28 years (IQR 18-41) were included in the study. Prevalence of malaria was 25.1%, 95% CI [19.8-31.0] and 30.4%, 95% CI [24.7-36.7] for thin/thick smear and rapid malaria test, respectively. Eighteen patients (7.4%, 95% CI [4.4-11.5]) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and forty-two (17.3%, 95% CI [12.8-22.6]) were positive for IgM and/or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 IgM seroprevalence was significantly higher in malaria RDT positive participants (33.8% vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study confirms a possible cross-reactivity between Covid-19 and malaria in case of single use of rapid tests, suggesting a possible past contamination. In case of clinical signs related to Covid-19 in malaria-endemic areas, PCR screening should be requested in order to identify and isolate patients.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Current documents have demonstrated that the virus causes a PGE2 storm in a substantial proportion of patients via upregulating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and downregulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-degrading enzymes within the host cell. AIM: Herein, we aimed to study how short-term treatment with celecoxib (Celebrex), a selective COX-2 inhibitor, affects demographic features, early symptoms, O2 saturation, and hematological indices of cases with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 67 confirmed COVID-19 cases with a mild or moderate disease, who had been referred to an institutional hospital in south-eastern Iran from October 2020 to September 2021, were enrolled. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, and hematological indices of the patients were recorded within different time periods. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine differences between data sets based on normal data distribution. RESULTS: O2 saturation was statistically different between the control group and patients receiving celecoxib (p = 0.039). There was no marked difference between the groups in terms of the symptoms they experienced (p > 0.05). On the first days following Celebrex therapy, analysis of complete blood counts showed that white blood cell (WBC) counts were markedly lower in patients treated with a high dose of celecoxib (0.4 g/day) than in controls (p = 0.026). However, mean lymphocyte levels in patients receiving a high dose of celecoxib (0.4 g/day) were markedly higher than in patients receiving celecoxib with half of the dose (0.2 g/day) for one week or the untreated subjects (p = 0.004). Changes in platelet count also followed the WBC alteration pattern. CONCLUSION: Celecoxib is a relatively safe, inexpensive, and widely available drug with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory properties. The therapeutic efficacy of celecoxib depends on the administrated dose. Celecoxib might improve disease-free survival in patients with COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The results showed that basic psychological needs satisfaction exerted negative effects on adolescents' depression in both a direct and an indirect way. In specific, basic psychological needs satisfaction not only directly reduced depression, but also indirectly reduced depression by the mediating role of feelings of safety, but not by rumination. Moreover, autonomy and relatedness, but not competence need satisfaction, indirectly reduced depression by the multiple mediating path from feelings of safety to rumination.

Furthermore, while myocardial abnormalities have been reported in patients who recovered from COVID-19, the cardiac impact of extensive endurance exercise in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 remains unknown. We therefore aim to investigate (potentially detrimental) cardiac effects of first-time marathon training and participation, including a subset of participants who recovered from COVID-19, in apparently healthy middle-aged men. STUDY DESIGN: This exploratory prospective cohort study investigates cardiac effects of first-time marathon running in 24 middle-aged (35-50 years) healthy men. Primary outcomes are cardiac morphological changes from pre-training up to 1 month after marathon completion, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 time points: 1) baseline (4 months before the marathon), 2) pre-marathon (2 weeks before the marathon), 3) post-marathon (<24h post-marathon), and 4) recovery (4 weeks after the marathon). Secondary parameters include other cardiac or non-cardiac changes: 1) quantitative MRI myocardial mapping, including mean diffusivity and extracellular volume fraction, 2) echocardiographic morphology and function changes, 3) VO2max, 4) electrocardiogram changes, and 5) levels of cardiac biomarkers. DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to our understanding of cardiac adaptations and maladaptations to first-time marathon running in middle-aged men, and the interaction between extreme endurance exercise and potential detrimental cardiac effects, also in the context of COVID-19.

These techniques are applicable to healthcare domain for accurate and timely prediction. Convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning methods which has become dominant in various computer vision tasks and is attracting interest across a variety of domains, including radiology. Lung diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), bacterial and viral pneumonias, and COVID-19 are not predicted accurately due to availability of very few samples for either of the lung diseases. The disease could be easily diagnosed using X-ray or CT scan images. But the number of images available for each of the disease is not as equally as other resulting in imbalance nature of input data. Conventional supervised machine learning methods do not achieve higher accuracy when trained using a lesser amount of COVID-19 data samples. Image data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. Data augmentation helped reduce overfitting when training a deep neural network. The SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm is used for the purpose of balancing the classes. The novelty in this research work is to apply combined data augmentation and class balance techniques before classification of tuberculosis, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The classification accuracy obtained with the proposed multi-level classification after training the model is recorded as 97.4% for TB and pneumonia and 88% for bacterial, viral, and COVID-19 classifications. The proposed multi-level classification method produced is ~8 to ~10% improvement in classification accuracy when compared with the existing methods in this area of research. The results reveal the fact that the proposed system is scalable to growing medical data and classifies lung diseases and its sub-types in less time with higher accuracy.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of long-COVID in children with immunodeficiency, in comparison to those without. A self-constructed questionnaire was created, which included questions regarding the child's general health, the course of their COVID-19, their symptoms of long-COVID and its impact on their daily functioning, the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and vaccination status. The questionnaire was completed by parents of 147 children - 70 children with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency (47.6%) and 77 who were immunocompetent (52.4%). Immunocompetent children were more significantly affected by long-COVID than those immunocompromised. Its prevalence in the first 12-week post-infection was 60.0% and 35.7% in these groups, respectively. Beyond this period, these percentages had dropped to 34.6% and 11.43%, respectively. Children who were immunocompetent reported more often symptoms of fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Meanwhile, there was a slight increase in complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompromised patients. The risk of developing long-COVID increased with age and COVID-19 severity in both groups. Furthermore, the daily activities of immunocompetent children were limited more frequently (41.8%) than for those who were immunocompromised (25%). CONCLUSIONS: Although immunocompromised children experienced long-COVID, its prevalence and impact on daily functioning were significantly lower than among immunocompetent children. However, as the pathomechanisms of long-COVID are not yet fully understood, it is not currently possible to fully explain these findings. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following COVID-19, which can affect various tissues and organs, as well as mental health. * Due to the similar course of COVID-19 - mainly mild or asymptomatic - among children with and without immunodeficiency, the question arises, over whether the prevalence and severity of long-COVID is also similar in both groups. WHAT IS NEW: * Immunocompromised children also suffer from long-COVID, but the prevalence is significantly lower than in the immunocompetent group of children. * The potential causes of less frequent and milder long-COVID in this group may be the milder course of COVID-19 and the state of reduced immunity protecting against neuroinflammation.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

We compared the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab amongst advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) >/= 50% before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Advanced NSCLC patients initiating pembrolizumab between June 2015 and December 2019 (\"pre-pandemic cohort\") and between March 2020 and March 2021 (\"pandemic cohort\") at BC Cancer were identified retrospectively. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated risk factors for immune-related adverse events (irAE) >/= grade 3 at the 6 week, 3 month, and 6 month landmarks. Cox regression models of overall survival (OS) were constructed. RESULTS: The study population comprised 417 patients in the pre-pandemic cohort and 111 patients in the pandemic cohort. Between March and May 2020, 48% fewer advanced NSCLC cases with PD-L1 TPS >/= 50% were diagnosed compared to similar intervals in 2018-2019. Telemedicine assessment [new patient consultations (p < 0.001) and follow-up (p < 0.001)] and extended interval pembrolizumab dosing (p < 0.001) were more common in the pandemic cohort. Patients initiating pembrolizumab after February 2020 (vs. before January 2020) experienced similar odds of developing severe irAE. 2/111 (1.8%) patients receiving pembrolizumab during the pandemic tested positive for COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological status and related risk and protective factors of adolescents after two months of family confinement for preventing COVID-19 in China, and compare them with baseline data. We surveyed teenagers in January 2020 before the COVID-19 outbreak (T1) and after home confinement (T2). We used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Scale and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). 13,637 valid questionnaires were collected at T1, of which 22.34% reported depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >/= 10) and 14.42% reported anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 >/= 10). At T2, the rates decreased to 14.86 and 7.44%, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Of the adolescents, 223 reported potential risk of exposure to COVID-19. We then compared them to the 9639 non-risk adolescents using a propensity score matching analysis. The adolescents with potential exposure risk had higher rates of depression (26.91 vs 15.32%, P = 0.0035) and anxiety (14.80 vs 7.21%, P = 0.01) than risk-free adolescents. Among adolescents with an exposure risk, psychological resilience was protective in preventing depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse, a poor parent-child relationship were risk factors.

Unfortunately, KT recipients also have a reduced response to SARS-CoV-2 immunization. The primary aim of this study was to assess immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in pediatric kidney transplant recipients 12-18 years of age. Secondary aims were to assess response rates following a third immunization and determine factors that influence immunization response. METHODS: Pediatric KT recipients in a single tertiary center received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination as per local protocol. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (IgG) was measured following second and/or third vaccination. Demographics including patient factors (age, gender, and underlying disease), transplant factors (time and type of transplant), and immunosuppression (induction, maintenance, and immunomodulatory therapies such as IVIG) were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: Of 20 participants, 10 (50%) responded following a two-dose vaccine schedule, which increased to 15 (75%) after three doses. Maintenance immunosuppression affected immunologic response, with azathioprine demonstrating a higher rate of response to vaccine compared to mycophenolate (100% vs. 38%, p = 0.04). Increasing prednisolone dose had a negative impact on immunologic response (0.01 mg/kg/day increase: OR 1.60 95% CI 1.01 to 2.57). Tacrolimus dose and trough levels, age, time post-transplant, underlying disease, and other immunosuppression did not impact immunologic response. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric KT recipients had similar response rates following SARS-CoV-2 immunization as adult KT recipients. Immunologic response improved following a third immunization.

In this study, an analysis of 40 consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases from December 2020 to September 2021 in Japan revealed that patients of 70 years and over were predisposed to a positive DAT. DAT positivity was related to a decrease in the hemoglobin level. Anemia in DAT-positive COVID-19 patients was attributed to hemolysis, which was corroborated by high reticulocyte counts and an increase in the red blood cell distribution width. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*12:01 and DRB1*12:02 were exclusively found in DAT-positive COVID-19 patients. In silico assays for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 predicted several common core peptides that met the criteria for a B cell epitope and strong binding to both HLA-DRB1*12:01 and DRB1*12:02. Among these peptides, the amino acids sequence TSNFR, which is found within the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, is shared by human blood group antigen Rhesus (Rh) CE polypeptides. In vitro analysis showed that the expression of HLA-DR in CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells from a DAT-positive patient was increased after pulsation with TSNFR-sequence-containing peptides. In summary, positive DAT is related to enhanced anemia and to HLA-DR12 in the Japanese population.

We have investigated the molecular nature of this interprotein interaction and the associated free energy diagrams for the unbinding of the two proteins for SARS-CoV-2 and some of its known variants through all-atom simulations. The present work involves generation and analysis of 2.5 mus of unbiased and 4.2 mus of biased molecular dynamics trajectories in total for five explicitly solvated RBD-ACE2 systems at full atomic level. First, we have made a comparative analysis of the details of residue-wise specific interactions of the spike protein with ACE2 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. It is found that the average numbers of both direct interprotein and water-bridged hydrogen bonds between the RBD and ACE2 are higher for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1. These higher hydrogen bonded interactions are further aided by enhanced nonspecific electrostatic attractions between the two protein surfaces for SARS-CoV-2. The free energy calculations reveal that there is an increase in the free energy barrier by approximately 1.5 kcal/mol for the unbinding of RBD from ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 compared to that for SARS-CoV-1. Subsequently, we considered the RBDs of three variants of SARS-CoV-2, namely N501Y, E484Q/L452R, and N440K. The free energy barrier of protein unbinding for the N501Y variant is found to be approximately 4 kcal/mol higher than the wild type SARS-CoV-2 which can be attributed to additional specific interactions involving Tyr501 of RBD and Lys353 and Tyr42 of ACE2 and also enhanced nonspecific electrostatic interaction between the protein surfaces. For the other two mutant variants of E484Q/L452R and N440K, the free energy barrier for protein unbinding increases by approximately 2 and approximately 1 kcal/mol, respectively, compared with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, which can be attributed to an increase in the number of interprotein hydrogen bonds for the former and also to enhanced positive electrostatic potential on the RBD surfaces for both of the variants. The successive breaking of interprotein hydrogen bonds along the free energy pathway of the unbinding process is also found out for all five systems studied here.", "FAU": ["Dutta, Saheb", "Panthi, Bhavana", "Chandra, Amalendu"], "AU": ["Dutta S", "Panthi B", "Chandra A"], "AD": ["Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh 208016, India.", "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh 208016, India.", "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh 208016, India."], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0003-1223-8326"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Phys Chem B", "JT": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The comparison group averaged 236.7 metres [126; 380] (T=8, p=0.047) after the rehabilitation course and the intervention group averaged 233.71 metres [150; 320] (T=8.0, p=0.047). When tested with the Euro-QL-5D questionnaire, a post-treatment improvement was noted in the comparison group on the anxiety/depression subscale (3 [3;3] (T=0, p=0.043)). In the intervention group, laser Doppler flowmetry revealed a statistically significant increase in microcirculation (6.36 standard units after rehabilitation) [5.54; 8.17] (T=7.0, p=0.004), and a decrease of oxidative metabolism index of 6.89 standard units. [4.76; 6.96] (T=4.0, p=0.03). No serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, the developed aquatic exercises technique seems to contribute to recovery of impaired upright posture and motor function, normalizing the walking pattern.", "FAU": ["Lobanov, Andrey A", "Irina A Grishechkina", "Andronov, Sergei V", "Gleb N Barashkov", "Andrey I Popov", "Anatoliy D Fesyun", "Elena P Ivanova", "Maccarone, Maria Chiara", "Stefano Masiero"], "AU": ["Lobanov AA", "Irina A Grishechkina", "Andronov SV", "Gleb N Barashkov", "Andrey I Popov", "Anatoliy D Fesyun", "Elena P Ivanova", "Maccarone MC", "Stefano Masiero"], "AD": ["National Medical Research Center, National Research Medical Center, Moscow. alobanov89@gmail.com.", "National Medical Research Center, National Research Medical Center, Moscow. grishechkinaIA@nmicrk.ru.", "National Medical Research Center, National Research Medical Center, Moscow. sergius198010@mail.ru.", ".

The aim was to study the level and predictors of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life and functional disability in COVID-19 survivors during the first year post intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study, reported following the STROBE guidance, was conducted in adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to an Italian ICU from March 2020 to March 2021 who were followed until March 2022. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were included in the study, of which 145 (70.1%) were male. One hundred and six (51.2%) patients between six and 12 months after ICU discharge reported at least one physical or cognitive impairment. The concurrent prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD is present in 25/106 patients (23.6% of cases) at six months and increases in 29/106 patients (27.3% of cases) at 12 months. However, the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD was observed in 86 patients (41.5%) at six months and it gets smaller in 78 patients (37.7%) at 12 months (p= .049). The EqVAS score (58.8 vs 72.3, p= .017) and the Barthel Index (61.5 vs 74.8, p< .001) increased significantly between six and 12 months after ICU.

Ongoing provision of alloHCT has required dynamic responses at national and local levels. In Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), a high reliance on unrelated donors from overseas registries has posed an additional challenge. AIMS: To describe the impact of COVID-19 on alloHCT services in ANZ in the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: Data from the national alloHCT recipient and unrelated donor registries was extracted for a 2-year time frame. Comparisons were made between a pre-pandemic period of 1st March 2019 to 29th February 2020 and the corresponding dates during the pandemic, 1st March 2020 to 28th February 2021. RESULTS: There was a 13% decrease in the number of allogeneic transplants, a reversal of steady increases in previous years, with the largest decrease in unrelated donor transplants. Local donors supplied a greater proportion of unrelated stem cell products. With a switch to universal cryopreservation, the time from request of a product to infusion increased by a median of 25.5 days for overseas products and 14 days for local products. There was a significant increase in the number of products collected but not used. CONCLUSIONS: A strong public health response and coordinated transplant community activities allowed for safe provision of alloHCT in ANZ, however our data suggests that the timely delivery of allogeneic transplants was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The infection is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from no signs of illness to severe pathological complications that go beyond the typical respiratory symptoms. On this note, new-onset neurological and neuropsychiatric syndromes have been increasingly reported in a large fraction of COVID-19 patients, thus potentially representing a significant public health threat. Although the underpinning pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, a growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an autoimmune response, which could potentially contribute to the establishment and/or exacerbation of neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients. Shedding light on this aspect is urgently needed for the development of effective therapeutic intervention. This review highlights the current knowledge of the immune responses occurring in Neuro-COVID patients and discusses potential immune-mediated mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger neurological complications.

There are limited data on the incidence rates and risk factors associated with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients with COVID-19. A rapid review has been designed to investigate whether there is a relationship between COVID-19 and GIB in adult patients. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases have been analyzed. A total of 129 studies were found; 29 full texts were analyzed, and of these, 20 were found to be relevant to the topic. The key findings of the included studies present an overall GIB rate in COVID-19 patients ranging from 1.1% to 13%. The bleeding involves mucosal damage of the duodenum, stomach, colon, and rectum. The management of gastrointestinal bleeding could be conservative. The use of fecal diversion systems for the management of diarrhea in COVID-19 patients should be minimized and closely evaluated for the risk of rectal mucosal damages and erosions.

The results were reported as the pooled prevalence rates and the odds ratios (ORs), with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Out of 648 records, we included nine studies. The prevalence of stroke patients with COVID-19 who received MT treatment was with TICI >/=2b 79% (95%CI: 73-85), symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage 6% (95%CI: 3-11), parenchymal haematoma type 1, 11.1% (95%CI: 5-23), and mortality 29% (95%CI: 24-35).

The value of positive leadership characteristics has never been more critical than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Functioning in a crisis mode required nurse leaders to demonstrate the necessary skills for clear communication and solid leadership. Therefore, nursing leadership, especially in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, needs to be transformative in the sense that leaders are informational, motivating, and able to advance the organization, notwithstanding a global pandemic. Timely leadership research during and after COVID-19 is crucial for filling the literature gap resulting from the unique changes in the nursing profession in the post-pandemic period. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate leadership characteristics shown by nurse leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate nurses' perceptions of nurse leader effectiveness based on leaders' work roles. METHODS: An exploratory, quantitative study was conducted 18 months after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic (June-August 2021). The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5X) was sent to registered nurses (RNs) in Texas using the State Board's listing of active RNs. In total, 70 practicing RNs participated in the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate correlational analysis. RESULTS: Perceived leadership characteristics remained primarily transformational. Nurse directors and executives reported positive leadership characteristics more frequently than did staff and charge nurses. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Specific tactics and strategies must be adopted to support nurses and nursing leadership during ongoing healthcare challenges. Close monitoring of leadership characteristics will enable organizations to support and provide educational opportunities for ongoing organizational success.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Sigma Theta Tau

Here, we repurposed antiviral drugs against both viral and host enzymes to pharmaceutically block methylation of the viral RNA 2'-O-ribose cap needed for viral immune escape. We find that the host cap 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase MTr1 can compensate for loss of viral NSP16 methyltransferase in facilitating virus replication. Concomitant inhibition of MTr1 and NSP16 efficiently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication. Using in silico target-based drug screening, we identify a bispecific MTr1/NSP16 inhibitor with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and in vivo but with unfavorable side effects. We further show antiviral activity of inhibitors that target independent stages of the host SAM cycle providing the methyltransferase co-substrate. In particular, the adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) inhibitor DZNep is antiviral in vitro, ex vivo and in a mouse infection model, and synergizes with existing COVID-19 treatments. Moreover, DZNep exhibits a strong immunomodulatory effect curbing infection-induced hyperinflammation, and reduces lung fibrosis markers ex vivo. Thus, multi-specific and metabolic MTase inhibitors constitute yet unexplored treatment options against COVID-19.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

spondylitis (AS), has been variable. Here, we assess disease activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through the pandemic in patients with AS. METHODS: In the open-label extension (OLE) of the phase 2b BE AGILE study, patients with AS received 160 mg of subcutaneous bimekizumab every 4 weeks. We assessed Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) scores in the OLE immediately before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2019 to April 2021). RESULTS: A total of 232 patients remained in the BE AGILE OLE and were included in this post hoc study at the start of the analysis period (September 1, 2019); 12 patients had a COVID-19 treatment-emergent adverse event, and no cases resulted in death. The number of missed bimekizumab doses due to COVID-19 (11 doses) was minimal, and missed assessments remained low (</=5%) compared with the prepandemic period. Mean ASDAS-CRP (1.8), BASDAI (2.4), and ASQoL scores (2.8) in the OLE were low at pre-pandemic baseline and remained stable at 1.7 to 1.8, 2.2 to 2.4, and 2.0 to 2.8, respectively, across successive 3-month periods immediately before and during the pandemic. ASDAS-CRP, BASDAI, and ASQoL stability was consistent across major study countries. CONCLUSION: Disease activity and HRQoL remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with AS receiving bimekizumab in the BE AGILE OLE, with no indication of negative effects on these outcomes.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy-five participants in the UK completed an online survey. RESULTS: Half of the participants experienced clinical levels of anxiety and/or depression, and 20% reported suicidal feelings as a result of the uncertainty about treatment due to the pandemic. Support from friends, family and online forums were reported by more than half of participants, but support from fertility clinics or counsellors were reported by less than one quarter. The strategy used most frequently to cope with the uncertainty about treatment due to the pandemic was self-distraction, and this predicted reduced depression. However, self-blame, behavioral disengagement and venting predicted increased depression and self-blame, behavioral disengagement, and denial predicted increased anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fertility clinic communication and psychological support, such as counselling, which had substantially reduced during treatment cessation, could include some focus on personal coping, including what to avoid. Psychological support is likely to be more important now than ever.

When no specific eliciting factors are found, chronic urticaria is defined as spontaneous (CSU). Up to 50% of patients with CSU do not respond to therapy, leading to a prolonged disease course and the need for expensive therapies, impacting the quality of life (QoL) and healthcare resources. AREAS COVERED: : Diagnosis of CSU is made when other potential causes of chronic urticaria are excluded. CSU therapy aims to achieve complete control of symptoms and normalization of QoL. Current treatment options for urticaria aim to target mast cell mediators such as histamine, or activators, such as autoantibodies. Guidelines recommend starting with second generation antihistamines (sgAHs) and adding omalizumab therapy if symptoms are not controlled. This review aims to provide a practical guide for CSU in the pediatric population. EXPERT OPINION: : Treatment options for pediatric CSU are primarily based on adult data that have been extrapolated for children.

Today, with nurses increasingly deployed to provide critical care during natural, man-made and public health crises that can resemble battlefield situations, there is much to learn from battlefield nurses. This qualitative study explores the lessons of the experiences of civilian nurses deployed to Israeli battlefields in three wars between 1967 and 1982. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with twenty-two former military nurses who were deployed in three wars between 1967 and 1982. We analysed interview transcripts using a content analysis approach. COREQ, a 32-item checklist, guided method selection, data analysis and the findings' presentation. FINDINGS: Data analysis revealed three main themes, with ten related subthemes: Field Service Challenges, Coping with Challenges, and Nurses' Need for Recognition. CONCLUSION: The findings identify mental, emotional, and organizational issues resulting from nurses' wartime experiences, revealing numerous opportunities for better preparing and supporting critical care nurses before, during, and after crises. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Critical care nursing during crises, such as wartime, is unique but increasingly common. The memories and ongoing impact of those experiences offer invaluable information for nursing and health policy stakeholders planning for future deployments during wartime or other disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian war.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Authors.

This study sought to examine associations between COVID-19-related socioeconomic insecurity and mental health outcomes among asylum seekers. METHODS: The authors evaluated the association between the degree of food, housing, and income insecurity related to the pandemic and mental health outcomes among East African asylum seekers in a high-risk, postdisplacement setting in the Middle East (i.e., Israel). RESULTS: Anxiety symptom severity (p=0.03) as well as the rate of suicidal ideation among women (odds ratio [OR]=2.81, p=0.016) were significantly elevated in a community sample of asylum seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=66) relative to a similar sample (N=158) from the same community and context assessed before the pandemic. No differences between the two groups were observed for severity or rate of probable depression or posttraumatic stress disorders. In addition, among the sample assessed during the pandemic, socioeconomic insecurity due to the pandemic was strongly associated with elevated symptom severity and probable anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorders as well as suicidal ideation (R(2) range=0.19-0.35; OR range=4.54-5.46). CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with growing evidence of a mental health crisis among asylum seekers that is linked to COVID-19 control policies and residential status policies.

Recurrent inflammation of the trigeminovascular system has been hypothesized. It was noted that some long-term attack-free cluster headache patients suddenly developed a new cluster episode shortly after COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Cases are described from patients with cluster headache who reported a new cluster episode within days after COVID-19 vaccination. All cases were seen in a tertiary university referral center and a general hospital in the Netherlands between March 2021 and December 2021, when the first COVID-19 vaccinations were carried out in The Netherlands. Clinical characteristics of the previous and new cluster episodes, and time between the onset of a new cluster episode and a previous COVID-19 vaccination were reported. RESULTS: We report seven patients with cluster headache, who had been attack-free for a long time, in whom a new cluster episode occurred within a few days after a COVID-19 vaccination. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccinations may trigger new cluster episodes in patients with cluster headache, possibly by activating a pro-inflammatory state of the trigeminocervical complex. COVID-19 vaccinations may also exacerbate other neuroinflammatory conditions. .", "FAU": ["Brandt, Roemer B", "Ouwehand, Rosa-Lin H", "Ferrari, Michel D", "Haan, Joost", "Fronczek, Rolf"], "AU": ["Brandt RB", "Ouwehand RH", "Ferrari MD", "Haan J", "Fronczek R"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2932-4872"], "AD": ["Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.", "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.", "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.", "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.", "Department of Neurology, Alrijne Hospital, Leiderdorp, The Netherlands.", "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "England", "TA": "Cephalalgia", "JT": "Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache", "JID": "8200710", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19 vaccination", "Cluster headache", "headache"], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/15 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 02:45"], "PHST": ["2022/07/14 02:45 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1177/03331024221113207 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Cephalalgia. 2022 Jul 13:3331024221113207. doi: 10.1177/03331024221113207."}, {"PMID": "35832019", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220714", "IS": "1365-3156 (Electronic) 1360-2276 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "Effects of a community-driven water, sanitation, and hygiene program on Covid-19 symptoms, vaccine acceptance, and non-Covid illnesses: a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Democratic Republic of Congo.", "LID": "10.1111/tmi.13799 [doi]", "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo responded to Covid-19 with policy measures such as business and school closures and distribution of vaccines, which rely on citizen compliance. In other settings, prior experience with effective government programs has increased compliance with public health measures. We study the effect of a national water, sanitation, and hygiene program on compliance with COVID-19 policies. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 332 communities were randomly assigned to the Villages et Ecoles Assainis program or control. After COVID-19 reached DRC, individuals who owned phones (590/1312; 45%) were surveyed by phone three times between May 2020-August 2021. Primary outcomes were COVID symptoms, non-COVID illness symptoms, child health, psychological well-being, and vaccine acceptance. Secondary outcomes included COVID-19 preventive behavior and knowledge, and perceptions of governmental performance, including COVID response. All outcomes were self-reported. Outcomes were compared between treatment and control villages using linear models. RESULTS: The VEA program did not affect respondents' COVID symptoms (-0.11, 95% CI -0.55, 0.33), non-COVID illnesses (-0.01, 95% CI -0.05, 0.03), child health (0.07, 95% CI -0.19, 0.33), psychological well-being (-0.05, 95% CI -0.35, 0.24), or vaccine acceptance (-0.04, 95% CI -0.19, 0.10). There was no effect on village-level COVID-19 preventive behavior (0.02, 95% CI -0.17, 0.22), COVID-19 knowledge (0.16, 95% CI -0.08, 0.39), or trust in institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Although the VEA program increased access to improved water and sanitation, it did not increase trust in government.

During the pandemic, the frontline healthcare workers experience intense anxiety, stress, burnout, and psychological breakdown, with severe implications on their mental and physical well-being. In addition to these implications, anxiety and stress can hinder their productivity and ability to perform their duties efficiently. The literature indicates that hospital gardens and contact with nature can help alleviate psychological distress among hospital staff. However, few studies investigated the role of outdoor spaces as areas for respite and work breaks in healthcare facilities during the pandemic. The present opinion paper highlights the challenges of job stress and psychological distress health workers face during the pandemic. This article also underscores the role of hospital outdoor spaces and garden facilities in coping with the challenges. While other measures to reduce stress among hospital staff and ensure their health and safety are important, hospital administrators and relevant government agencies should also emphasize the provision of gardens and open spaces in healthcare facilities. These spaces can act as potential areas for respite for hospital staff to help them cope with the stress and anxiety accumulated through working under crises.", "FAU": ["Iqbal, Saad Arslan", "Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi"], "AU": ["Iqbal SA", "Abubakar IR"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-1828", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7994-2302"], "AD": ["Department of Educational Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.", "College of Architecture and Planning, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (Formerly, University of Dammam), Dammam, Saudi Arabia."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "HERD", "JT": "HERD", "JID": "101537529", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "access to nature", "gardens", "healing gardens", "healthcare workers", "hospital outdoor spaces", "landscape planning", "mental health", "staff safety", "stress and burnout"], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/15 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 01:33"], "PHST": ["2022/07/14 01:33 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1177/19375867221111530 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "HERD. 2022 Jul 13:19375867221111530. doi: 10.1177/19375867221111530."}, {"PMID": "35831994", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220714", "IS": "2167-5112 (Electronic) 1937-5867 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "Nursing Home Adoption of CDC and ASHRAE COVID-19 Built Environment Recommendations: A Characterization Study of Colorado Nursing Home Facilities.", "PG": "19375867221111478", "LID": "10.1177/19375867221111478 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ASHRAE provided infection control recommendations for the built environments and ventilation systems of nursing homes (NHs). The level of adoption of the suggested strategies is unknown, as little information has been obtained from NHs identifying the strategies that were implemented. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of our study was to characterize the built environments of Colorado NHs during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the level of adoption of CDC and ASHRAE recommendations. Our secondary goal was to identify opportunities and barriers that NHs face as they work to create health-protective built environments in the future. METHOD: We used the Nursing Home Built Environment survey to obtain data related to three main categories of CDC and ASHRAE recommendation for Colorado NHs: Resident Isolation, Improved Indoor Air Quality, and Staff Separation/Support. RESULTS: Key findings included: (1) On average, NHs had 34% of their beds located in single-occupancy rooms; (2) seven (9%) NHs had designated COVID-positive \"neighborhoods\"; (3) 14 (20%) NHs had common area ventilation systems that were utilizing filters with a minimum efficiency reporting value 13 rating, or higher. CONCLUSION: Most Colorado NHs did not fully implement the COVID-19 built environment strategies recommended by CDC and ASHRAE. While there are barriers to the adoption of many of the strategies, there are also opportunities for immediate improvements that can support the health of vulnerable NH populations as we continue to see high rates of aerosolized infectious disease spread in NH facilities.", "FAU": ["Goldman, Cedra", "Czaja, Christopher", "Moses, X J Ethan", "Van Dyke, Mike"], "AU": ["Goldman C", "Czaja C", "Moses XJE", "Van Dyke M"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6536-214X"], "AD": ["The Colorado School of Public Health, Denver, CO, USA.", "Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Denver, CO, USA.", "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Colorado School of Public Health, CU Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.", "The Colorado School of Public Health, Denver, CO, USA.", "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Center for Health, Work & Environment, Colorado School of Public Health, CU Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "HERD", "JT": "HERD", "JID": "101537529", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID", "built environment", "long-term care", "nursing home", "ventilation"], "EDAT": "2022/07/15 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/15 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/14 01:33"], "PHST": ["2022/07/14 01:33 [entrez]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/15 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1177/19375867221111478 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "HERD. 2022 Jul 13:19375867221111478. doi: 10.1177/19375867221111478."}, {"PMID": "35831943", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220714", "IS": "1538-4667 (Electronic) 0196-0202 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 14", "TI": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Universal Newborn Hearing Screening.", "LID": "10.1097/AUD.0000000000001255 [doi]", "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To report the direct and indirect impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening program of our institution (Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Sassari).

Given the extent of the challenges and impact presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to the hospitality industry, it is timely to gain further insights on employees' health well-being. The key purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between health-related quality of life, achievement motivation and job performance in the Taiwan hospitality industry, to acquire a better understanding of their relationships through the job performance pathway models. METHODS: This study has used a purposeful sampling technique to select the 10 highest-earning hospitality companies in Taiwan. A total of 292 questionnaires were collected from the employees of these hospitality companies. Based on the multi-dimensional concept of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the relationships between the five key dimensions (i.e. psychological health, physical health, social health, achievement motivation, and job performance) were examined. To measure these dimensions, the survey questions were adapted from previous research such as the World Health Organization's WHOQOL-BREF scale, Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. Partial least squares - Structural Equation Modeling method was used to explore these dimensions, and two job performance pathway models (for manager and staff) were subsequently developed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed that psychological health directly affected the manager's job performance and physical health had a similar effect through social health. While psychological health had not affected the staff's job performance, but it could affect achievement motivation through both direct and indirect effects of social health. The pathway models that were developed indicated that the manager's job performance was mainly affected by psychological health and social health, whereas the key dimension that had affected the staff's job performance was achievement motivation.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Understanding the enablers and challenges in implementation and delivery of these programs is important for future implementation and re-design. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of staff involved with the implementation and delivery, and the experience of patients managed by, a VHC monitoring service in Melbourne, Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach informed by naturalist inquiry was used. Staff interviews were analysed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Patient experience was captured using a survey and descriptive statistics were used to describe categorical responses while content analysis was used to analyse free text responses as they related to the CFIR. Finally, data from the interviews and patient experience were triangulated to see if patient experience validated data from staff interviews. RESULTS: All 15 staff were interviewed, and 271 patients were surveyed (42%). A total of four final overarching themes emerged: service implementation enablers, service delivery benefits for patients, fragmentation of care, and workforce strengths. 19 subthemes aligned with 18 CFIR constructs from staff and patient data. CONCLUSION: Rapid implementation was enabled through shared resources, dividing implementation tasks between senior personnel, engaging furloughed healthcare staff in design and delivery, and having a flexible approach that allowed for ongoing improvements. Benefits for patients included early identification of COVID-19 deterioration, as well as provision of accurate and trustworthy information to isolate safely at home.

AIM: This study aims to investigate the role of religion as a factor in adherence to the COVID-19 medical directives in Palestine. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed from August to October 2021. In this study, 1,353 participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that consisted of 20 items that measured the impact of religious beliefs and the role played by religious scholars in the promotion and application of medically-approved health directives and the rectification of COVID-19 related information. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 22 software. RESULTS: More than 50% of the participants agreed that religion has a positive impact on community adherence to the health instructions in the majority of studied items. The responses were significantly variable based on the age and place of residence in most of the questions (p-value < 0.05). However, gender and to a lesser extent, the level of education affected the responses to many research aspects less significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Religion could be an effective tool in dealing with challenging health issues such as COVID-19.

Regarding SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibody levels has been shown to be a good indicator of antibody immune response boosting. So far, limited data have been reported from Africa including in Central Africa. The objective of this study was to provide data on anti-S1 spike total IgG and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated and non-vaccinated including naturally infected Congolese population during B.1.214.1 and B.1.617.2 variant waves. METHODS: Recruited patients were divided into 4 groups: (1) Naturally infected by the B.1.214.1 variant on January 2021 and followed up until September 2021. These patients have been vaccinated at month 07 and then followed up for 2 months post vaccination; (2) Naturally infected by the B.1.617.2 variant from June 2021; (3) unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 individuals with no history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; (4) fully vaccinated individuals with sinopharm/BBIP-CorV or Janssen/Ad26.COV2.S. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by qRT-PCR and sequenced using Next-Generation Sequencing. ELISA method was used for detecting IgG, and neutralizing Antibody against SARS-CoV-2 antigens using commercial neutralizing assay. RESULTS: Individuals infected by the B.1214.1 variant elicited consistently high IgG titers at 02, 03 and 06 months. Two months post vaccination with BBIP-CorV, participants showed a significant increase by x 2.5 fold (p < 0.0001) of total IgG and X1.5 fold for neutralizing antibody capacity. This study showed that natural infection with B1.617.2 (delta) variant was more immunogenic compared to those being infected with B1.214.2 variant. We found a significantly higher concentration in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (p < 0.0002) and antibodies neutralization capacity (P < 0.0001) in fully vaccinated compared to unvaccinated participants. Two months post vaccination, individuals who received Janssen/Ad26.COV2.S presented higher (p = 0.01) total IgG to spike protein compared to BBIP-CorV. CONCLUSION: Both natural infection and vaccination with BBIP-CorV and Janssen/Ad26.COV2.S induced antibody response in Congolese population. In addition, Janssen/Ad26.COV2.S was more immunogenic than Sinopharm/BBIP-CorV. There is a need to investigate the duration of these antibodies both in previously infected and naive vaccinated Congolese to allow public heath stakeholders to make evidence-based decision on vaccine schedule for the Congolese population.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

These changes may affect quality of care and limit opportunities for clinicians to counsel pregnant individuals, who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes, about prevention and vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of United States adults on changes in prenatal care, COVID-19 vaccine willingness, and reasons for unwillingness to receive a vaccine. We summarized changes in access to care and examined differences in vaccine willingness between pregnant and propensity-score matched non-pregnant controls using chi-squared tests and multivariable conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Between December 15-23, 2020, 8481 participants completed the survey, of which 233 were pregnant. Three-quarters of pregnant women (n = 186) experienced a change in prenatal care, including format of care (n = 84, 35%) and reduced visits (n = 69, 24%). Two-thirds experienced a change in birth plans, from a hospital birth to home birth (n = 45, 18%) or vaginal birth to a Cesarean delivery (n = 42, 17%). Although 40% of pregnant women (n = 78) were unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccination, they had higher, though non-significant, odds of reporting willingness to receive vaccination compared to similar non-pregnant women (aOR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.00). CONCLUSION: To support pregnant women through the perinatal care continuum, maternity care teams should develop protocols to foster social support, patient-centered education around infection prevention that focuses on improved risk perception, expected changes in care due to COVID-19, and vaccine effectiveness and safety.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Three linear models were developed with the regression line to depict the mutational load for S-glycoprotein, total genome excluding S-glycoprotein, and whole genome. Second, the continent-wide evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with their clades and divergence were evaluated. It showed the region-wise evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and their clustering event. The major clades for each variant were identified. One example is clade 21K, a major clade of the Omicron variant. Third, lineage dynamics and comparison between SARS-CoV-2 lineages across different countries are also illustrated, demonstrating dominant variants in various countries over time. Fourth, gene-wise mutation patterns and genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 variants across various countries are illustrated. High mutation patterns were found in the ORF10, ORF6, S, and low mutation pattern E genes. Finally, emerging AA point mutations (T478K, L452R, N501Y, S477N, E484A, Q498R, and Y505H), their frequencies, and country-wise occurrence were identified, and the highest event of two mutations (T478K and L452R) was observed.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In this study, it was aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine both the incidence and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission rates and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were closely followed during the design, analysis, and reporting of this systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was performed for the published papers in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, medRxiv, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. SARS-CoV-2 infection pooled incidence in the cancer populations and the risk ratio (RR) of ICU admission rates/mortality in cancer and non-cancer groups, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies, involving 709,908 participants and 31,732 cancer patients, were included in this study. The incidence in cancer patients was calculated as 8% (95% CI: 8-9%). Analysis results showed that mortality and ICU admission rate was significantly higher in patients with cancer (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.94-2.62, P < 0.001; RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.28-1.64, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: As a result, cancer was an important comorbidity and risk factor for all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This infection could result in severe and even fatal events in cancer patients. Cancer is associated with a poor prognosis in the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancer patients should be assessed more sensitively in the COVID-19 outbreak.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Telemedicine has advanced to the forefront of healthcare delivery, including maternal-fetal medicine. Smart wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) devices can enable pregnant women to monitor their health and that of their fetuses. Such technology would be a logical extension of the telemedicine ecosystem. METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study via online surveying in the United States. Study participants were recruited using the SurveyMonkey Audience Polling system and responded virtually. In all, the sample consisted of 507 women, aged 18-45 from 45 states, who are expecting to become pregnant in the next five years. Women were asked to identify their willingness to use a wearable ECG device the size of a patch-sized large band-aid on their abdomen. Ten binary or multiple-choice questions were used to gauge population interest and related demographics toward the usage of a wearable ECG device. RESULTS: Of the 507 participants, 461 (91%) women expressed an acceptance of wearable ECG technology throughout the pregnancy as a mechanism for increased frequency of monitoring of maternal and fetal health outside the hospital. 395 (78%) women demonstrated a willingness to wear devices day and night or at least during sleep and 213 (42%) of the women would spend up to $200 on such a device. CONCLUSION: Even though conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study clearly indicates a high degree of readiness of prospective pregnant women for telemedicine with continuous health monitoring of the mother-fetus dyad.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Patients were categorized on the basis of admission to intensive care units (ICUs) staffed by general intensivists or neurointensivists. Patients with primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. Baseline demographics, clinical complications, and outcomes were compared between groups using univariable and propensity score matching statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1141 patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 required ICU admission. ICUs were staffed by general intensivists (n = 1071) or neurointensivists (n = 70). Baseline demographics and presentation characteristics were similar between groups, except for patients admitted to neurointensivist-staffed ICUs being younger (59 vs. 65, p = 0.027) and having a higher PaO2/FiO2 ratio (153 vs. 120, p = 0.002). After propensity score matching, there was no correlation between ICU staffing and the use of mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressors. The rates of in-hospital mortality and hospice disposition were similar in neurointensivist-staffed COVID-19 units (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.31-2.64, p = 0.842). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surges precipitated a natural experiment in which neurology-trained neurointensivists provided critical care in a comparable context to general intensivists treating the same disease. Neurology-trained neurointensivists delivered comparable outcomes to those of general ICUs during COVID-19 surges. These results further support the role of NCC in meeting general critical care needs of neurocritically ill patients and as a viable surge resource in general critical care.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Many studies have focused on comparing Latinos to other groups, potentially masking critical concerns within population. This study identifies potential pathways to poor mental health among Latinos during the pandemic. METHODS: Data from US Census Household Pulse Survey, covering April 23, 2020, to October 11, 2021, were analyzed. Ordinal logistic regression evaluated categorical frequencies of problems with anxiety, loss of interest, worry, and feeling down. Findings were stratified by gender, poverty status, metropolitan location, and work. Demographic, household, financial, and work covariates were mutually adjusted, and jackknife replications and population weights applied. RESULTS: Adverse mental health was common, with higher frequencies of 2 or more adverse mental health symptoms for at least several days in the prior 2 weeks (59.1-76.3%, depending on stratified group). Food insufficiency was strongly associated with adverse mental health symptoms across all characteristics. Odds ratios of often not having enough to eat compared to enough of foods wanted being associated with adverse mental health ranged from 2.6 to 6.56 (depending on stratified group). Difficulty with expenses was also strongly associated with adverse mental health across characteristics, with odds ratios very difficult compared to not at all ranging from 2.7 to 7.7 (depending on stratified group). CONCLUSION: These observations suggest household financial hardship factors influence mental health regardless of other personal characteristics, and this could inform services for Latinos.

This article interprets the early impacts of COVID-19 on food insecurity (FI) in the Chicago and New York City (NYC) metropolitan areas for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and provides a study using a Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey adapted from the National Food Access and COVID Research Team (NFACT) was deployed in Chicago (N = 680) and in NYC (N = 525) during summer 2020 and oversampled for race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Multivariate binary logistic regression generated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs for FI and select SDOH variables, which was conducted on each dataset. RESULTS: The prevalence of FI in NYC increased to 66.8% (from 57.8%) and in Chicago to 44.8% (from 41.0%). While higher income protected against FI before, protection was diminished or eliminated since COVID-19. FI declined for households with children in NYC while odds increased and became significant in Chicago. Respondents with chronic health conditions experienced increased odds of FI since COVID. In Chicago, this variable had the highest odds of FI. Respondents with depression or anxiety had increased odds of FI. In NYC, depression had the highest odds of FI. Females in NYC were protected against FI. Hispanics in NYC lost protection against FI from before to since COVID-19.

AIM: Characterize the worldwide scientific literature about CMCR products, over the years, by means of a critical review. DESIGN: Electronic search was performed on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Lilacs, and Embase up to November 2020. Year, journal, country of authors, and type of study were the data extracted from the retrieved studies. Additional data of the clinical studies and systematic reviews were investigated. RESULTS: 2221 records were identified, 397 selected. 2011-2020 period concentrates higher number of publications (n = 169), in the Journal of Dental Research (n = 51), developed in Brazil (n = 45) and India (n = 44). Most studies were in vitro (n = 211) and clinical trials (n = 101).

Many studies have indicated the role of piperlongumine (PL) in anti-inflammation, but its effect on coagulation remains uncertain. Here, we explore whether PL could moderate coagulation indicators and alleviate lung inflammation during sepsis. RAW264.7 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with PL. Inflammatory and coagulation indicators, cell function and signaling, were evaluated in cells. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice were treated with PL by gavage. The harvested lungs and plasma were used to assess inflammation and coagulation indicators. As a result, PL increased the survival rate and reduced the concentrations of tissue factor (TF), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in CLP mice, with fibrinogen in reverse. Moreover, the PL alleviated inflammation, fibrin deposition, and lung injury in the lungs of CLP mice. In vitro, PL downregulated the expression of TF, PAI-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS. Furthermore, PL inhibited the phosphorylation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway's key proteins and suppressed the nuclear translocation of p-STAT3 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, this study suggests that PL may modulate coagulation indicators and improve lung inflammation through AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in sepsis.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

development of disease-modifying drugs and differential diagnostic agents is an urgent medical need in Parkinson's disease. Despite the complex pathophysiological pathway, the misfolding of alpha-synuclein has been identified as a putative biomarker for detecting the onset and progression of the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. Identifying the most appropriate alpha-synuclein-based diagnostic modality with clinical translation will revolutionize the diagnosis of Parkinson's. Likewise, molecules that target alpha-synuclein could alter the disease pathway that leads to Parkinson's and may serve as first-in class therapeutics compared to existing treatment options such as levodopa and dopamine agonist that do not necessarily modify the disease pathway. Notwithstanding the promising benefits that alpha-synuclein presents to therapeutics and diagnostics development for Parkinson's disease, finding ways to address potential challenges such as inadequate preclinical models, safety and efficacy will be paramount to achieving clinical translation. In this comprehensive review paper, we described the role of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, as well as how its structure and function relationship delineate disease onset and progression. We further discussed different alpha-synuclein-based diagnostic modalities including biomolecular assays and molecular imaging. Finally, we presented current small molecules and biologics that are being developed as disease-modifying drugs or positron emission tomography imaging probes for Parkinson's disease.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

In this study, we developed a prediction score (ThyroCOVID) for abnormal thyroid function (TFT) on admission amongst COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital were prospectively recruited during July 2020-May 2021. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) were measured on admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent determinants of abnormal TFTs. ThyroCOVID was developed based on a clinical model with the lowest Akaike information criteria. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty six COVID-19 patients were recruited (median age 50 years, 45.4% men, 72.9% mild disease on admission). 84 patients (15.4%) had abnormal TFTs on admission. Patients with abnormal TFTs were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, symptomatic, have worse COVID-19 severity, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and more adverse profile of acute-phase reactants, haematological and biochemical parameters. ThyroCOVID consisted of five parameters: symptoms (malaise), comorbidities (ischaemic heart disease/congestive heart failure) and laboratory parameters (lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, and SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values). It was able to identify abnormal TFT on admission with an AUROC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.67-0.79). The optimal cut-off of 0.15 had a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 65.2%, negative predictive value of 93.5% and positive predictive value of 28.1% in identifying abnormal TFTs on admission amongst COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: ThyroCOVID, a prediction score to identify COVID-19 patients at risk of having abnormal TFT on admission, was developed based on a cohort of predominantly non-severe COVID-19 patients.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Patients living in rural areas may have to travel long with subjectively great effort to be examined using all necessary interdisciplinary tools. This problem could be addressed with mobile outpatient clinics. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we investigated physical fitness, fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunction, and dyspnea in patients with post-COVID syndrome in a mobile interdisciplinary post-COVID outpatient clinic. Upon referral from their primary care physician, patients were offered an appointment at a mobile post-COVID outpatient clinic close to their home. RESULTS: We studied 125 patients (female, n = 79; 63.2%) in our mobile unit. All patients reported symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks after acute infection. 88.3% and 64.1% of patients reported significant impairment in physical and mental quality of life. Patients reported a median of three symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (86.4%), cognitive dysfunction (85.6%), and dyspnea (37.6%). 56.0% of patients performed at < 2.5th percentile at the 1 min sit-to-stand test compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and 25 patients (20.0%) exhibited a drop in oxygen saturation. A questionnaire given to each patient regarding the mobile unit revealed a very high level of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: There is an increasing need for high-quality and locally available care for patients with post-COVID syndrome.

We further examined long-term (12 months post-infection) sequelae of COVID-19 in these mice. Congested blood vessels, perivascular cavitation, pericellular halos, vacuolation of neuropils, pyknotic nuclei, acute eosinophilic necrosis, necrotic neurons with fragmented nuclei, and vacuolation were observed in the brain cortex 12 months post-MHV-1 infection. These changes were associated with increased reactive astrocytes and microglia, hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 and tau, and a decrease in synaptic protein synaptophysin-1, suggesting the possible long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on defective neuronal integrity. The lungs showed severe inflammation, bronchiolar airway wall thickening due to fibrotic remodeling, bronchioles with increased numbers of goblet cells in the epithelial lining, and bronchiole walls with increased numbers of inflammatory cells. Hearts showed severe interstitial edema, vascular congestion and dilation, nucleated red blood cells (RBCs), RBCs infiltrating between degenerative myocardial fibers, inflammatory cells and apoptotic bodies and acute myocyte necrosis, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Long-term changes in the liver and kidney were less severe than those observed in the acute phase. Noteworthy, the treatment of infected mice with a small molecule synthetic peptide which prevents the binding of spike protein to its respective receptors significantly attenuated disease progression, as well as the pathological changes observed post-long-term infection.

There was also a marked correlation between sebum lipids and the immunostimulatory hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in the COVID-19 positive cohort.

A major problem with state-of-the-art UV inactivation technology is that it is based on UV lamps, which have limited efficiency, require high power, large doses, and long irradiation times. These drawbacks limit the use of UV lamps in air filtering systems and other applications. To address these limitations, herein we report on the fabrication of a device comprising a pulsed nanosecond 266 nm UV laser coupled to an integrating cavity (LIC) composed of a UV reflective material, polytetrafluoroethylene. Previous UV lamp inactivation cavities were based on polished walls with specular reflections, but the diffuse reflective UV ICs were not thoroughly explored for virus inactivation. Our results show that LIC device can inactivate several respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, at ~ 1 ms effective irradiation time, with > 2 orders of magnitude higher efficiency compared to UV lamps. The demonstrated 3 orders of magnitude cavity enhancement relative to direct exposure is crucial for the development of efficient real-time UV air and water purification systems. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of LIC application for broad viral inactivation with high efficiency.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Mass testing could work as a powerful alternative to restrain disease dissemination, but the shortage of reagents is a limiting factor. A solution to optimize test usage relies on 'grouping' or 'pooling' strategies, which combine a set of individuals in a single reaction. To compare different group testing configurations, we developed the poolingr package, which performs an innovative hybrid in silico/in vitro approach to search for optimal testing configurations. We used 6759 viral load values, observed in 2389 positive individuals, to simulate a wide range of scenarios. We found that larger groups (>100) framed into multi-stage setups (up to six stages) could largely boost the power to detect spreaders. Although the boost was dependent on the disease prevalence, our method could point to cheaper grouping schemes to better mitigate COVID-19 dissemination through identification and quarantine recommendation for positive individuals.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The last significant variant of this virus, called as omicron, contributed to majority of cases in the third wave across globe. Though lesser in severity as compared to its predecessor, the delta variant, this mutation has shown higher communicable rate. This novel virus with symptoms of pneumonia is dangerous as it is communicable and hence, has engulfed entire world in a very short span of time. With the help of machine learning techniques, entire process of detection can be automated so that direct contacts can be avoided. Therefore, in this paper, experimentation is performed on CoViD19 chest X-ray images using higher order statistics with iterative and non-iterative models. Higher order statistics provide a way of analyzing the disturbances in the chest X-ray images. The results obtained are quite good with 96.64% accuracy using a non-iterative model. For fast testing of the patients, non-iterative model is preferred because it has advantage over iterative model in terms of speed.

Pandemic influenza A viruses (IAV) that crossed the avian-human species barrier switched from binding avian-type alpha2-3-linked sialic acid (2-3Sia) to human-type 2-6Sia receptors. Here, we show that this specificity switch is however less dichotomous as generally assumed. Binding and entry specificity were compared using mixed synthetic glycan gradients of 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia and by employing a genetically remodeled Sia repertoire on the surface of a Sia-free cell line and on a sialoglycoprotein secreted from these cells. Expression of a range of (mixed) 2-3Sia and 2-6Sia densities shows that non-binding human-type receptors efficiently enhanced avian IAV binding and entry provided the presence of a low density of high affinity avian-type receptors, and vice versa. Considering the heterogeneity of sialoglycan receptors encountered in vivo, hetero-multivalent binding is physiologically relevant and will impact evolutionary pathways leading to host adaptation.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

There were 22 267 HCW visits for suspected COVID-19; 7879 (35.4%) tested positive, and 14 388 (64.6%) tested negative. Fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea were positive predictors of COVID-19, and sore throat, headache, coryza, work in a COVID-19 area, and COVID-19 vaccination were negative predictors. Of the total number of visits, 41.2% were from vaccinated HCW and 58.8% were from unvaccinated HCW. Among HCWs with COVID-19, 84 (1.1%) required hospitalization, 11 (0.1%) in an intensive care unit (ICU), with three (0.04%) deaths.

Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to estimate the risk of global pediatric new-onset T1D, DKA, and severe DKA before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and EMBASE was conducted for articles published up to March 2022. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to compare the relative risk of T1D and DKA among pediatric patients with T1D between the COVID-19 pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. We also compared glucose and HbA1c values in children who were newly diagnosed with T1D before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The global incidence rate of T1D in the 2019 period was 19.73 per 100,000 children and 32.39 per 100,000 in the 2020 period. Compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic, the number of worldwide pediatric new-onset T1D, DKA, and severe DKA during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic increased by 9.5%, 25%, and 19.5%, respectively. Compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, the median glucose, and HbA1c values in newly diagnosed T1D children after the COVID-19 pandemic increased by 6.43% and 6.42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the risk of global pediatric new-onset T1D, DKA, and severe DKA. Moreover, higher glucose and HbA1c values in newly diagnosed T1D children after the COVID-19 pandemic mandates targeted measures to raise public and physician awareness.

This study examines rapid innovation of remote abortion service operations across health care settings and describes the use of telehealth consultations with medications delivered directly to patients. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 clinical staff from 4 practice settings: family planning clinics, online medical services, and primary care practices-independent or within multispecialty health systems. Clinicians and administrators described their telehealth abortion services. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Staff roles, policies, and procedures were compared across practice settings. RESULTS: Across all practice settings, telehealth abortion services consisted of 5 operational steps: patient engagement, care consultations, payment, medication dispensing, and follow-up communication. Online services and independent primary care practices used asynchronous methods to determine eligibility and complete consultations, resulting in more efficient services (2-5 minutes), while family planning and health system clinics used synchronous video encounters requiring 10-30 minutes of clinician time. Family planning and health system primary care clinics mailed medications from clinic stock or internal pharmacies, while independent primary care practices and online services often used mailorder pharmacies. Online services offered patients asynchronous follow-up; other practice settings scheduled synchronous appointments. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid innovations implemented in response to disrupted in-person reproductive health care included remote medication abortion services with telehealth assessment/follow-up and mailed medications. Though consistent operational steps were identified across health care settings, variation allowed for adaptation of services to individual sites.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 64 UK and Irish hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 1471 adults with community-acquired meningitis of any aetiology in 2017. RESULTS: None of the audit standards, from the 2016 UK Joint Specialists Societies guideline on diagnosis and management of meningitis, were met in all cases. With respect to 20 of 30 assessed standards, clinical management provided for patients was in line with recommendations in less than 50% of cases. 45% of patients had blood cultures taken within an hour of admission, 0.5% had a lumbar puncture within 1 hour, 26% within 8 hours. 28% had bacterial molecular diagnostic tests on cerebrospinal fluid. Median time to first dose of antibiotics was 3.2 hours (IQR 1.3-9.2). 80% received empirical parenteral cephalosporins. 55% >/=60 years and 31% of immunocompromised patients received anti-Listeria antibiotics. 21% received steroids. Of the 1471 patients, 20% had confirmed bacterial meningitis. Among those with bacterial meningitis, pneumococcal aetiology, admission to intensive care and initial Glasgow Coma Scale Score less than 14 were associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 4.48; aOR 4.28, 95% CI 1.81 to 10.1; aOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.26 to 6.71, respectively).

We here report the 15-month clinical course for an individual with multiple endocrine disorders of the pituitary gland and testis likely triggered by COVID-19. A 65-year-old man with no history of endocrinopathy was admitted for acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Although his respiratory condition improved after administration of antiviral drugs, his blood pressure dropped suddenly to a preshock level and was refractory to vasopressors. The circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations were low, and secondary adrenal insufficiency was suspected. Administration of hydrocortisone rapidly ameliorated the hypotension, and the patient was discharged taking 15 mg of hydrocortisone daily. An insulin tolerance test performed 3 months later revealed impaired ACTH, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) responses, indicative of combined hypopituitarism. The patient also manifested symptoms of hypogonadism, and a hormonal workup suggested primary hypogonadism. At 12 months after discharge, GH and ACTH responses had recovered completely and partially, respectively. After another 3 months, basal ACTH and cortisol levels had been restored to the normal range and the patient discontinued hydrocortisone replacement without exacerbation of symptoms, although his hypogonadism persisted. The patient thus developed transient GH and ACTH deficiency that lasted for more than a year as well as persistent primary hypogonadism during intensive care for COVID-19.

DESIGN: This study constructs an urban COVID-19 listed vaccine effectiveness (VE) monitoring, evaluation and application system based on the health code blockchain. This study uses this system and statistical simulation to analyse three urban application scenarios, namely evaluating the vaccination rate (VR) and determining the optimal vaccination strategy, evaluating herd immunity and monitoring the VE on variant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes first establish an urban COVID-19 listed VE monitoring, evaluation and application system by using the health code blockchain, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of VE, the evaluation index system of VE and the monitoring and evaluation system of personal privacy information use, and then three measures are analysed in urban simulation: one is to take the index reflecting urban population mobility as the weight to calculate the comprehensive VR, the second is to calculate the comprehensive basic reproduction number (R) in the presence of asymptomatic persons, the third is to compare the difference between the observed effectiveness and the true effectiveness of listed vaccines under virus variation. RESULTS: Combining this system and simulation, this study finds: (1) The comprehensive VR, which is weighted to reflect urban population mobility, is more accurate than the simple VR which does not take into account urban population mobility. Based on population mobility, the algorithm principle of urban optimal vaccination strategy is given. In the simulation of urban listed vaccination involving six regions, programmes 1 and 5 have the best protective effect among the eight vaccination programmes, and the optimal vaccination order is 3-5-2-4-6-1. (2) In the presence of asymptomatic conditions, the basic reproduction number, namely R0*(1-VR*VE), does not accurately reflect the effect of herd immunity, but the comprehensive basic reproduction number (R) should be used. The R is directly proportional to the proportion of asymptomatic people (aw) and the duration of the incubation period (ip), and inversely proportional to the VR, the VE and the number of days transmitted in the ip (k). In the simulation analysis, when symptomatic R0=3, even with aw=0.2, the R decreases to nearly 1 until the VR reaches 95%. When aw=0.8, even when the entire population is vaccinated, namely VR=1, the R is 1.688, and still significantly greater than 1. If the R is to be reduced to 1, the VE needs to be increased to 0.87. (3) This system can more comprehensively and accurately grasp the impact of the variant virus on urban VE. The traditional epidemiological investigation can lose the contacts of infected persons, which leads to the deviation between the observed effectiveness and the true effectiveness. Virus variation aggravates the loss, and then increases the deviation. Simulation case 1 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.8, the ongoing VR of 0.1, the completed VR of 0.1 and an average infection rate of 2% for the variant virus. If a vaccine is more than 90% effectiveness against the premutant virus, but only 80% effectiveness against the mutant virus, and because 80% of the unvaccinated people who are not infected are not observed, the observed effectiveness of the vaccine is 91.76%, it will lead to the wrong judgement that the VE against the variant virus is not decreased. Simulation case 2 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.8, the ongoing VR of 0.1, the completed VR of 0.1 and an average infection rate of 5% for the variant virus. Simulation finds that the higher the proportion of unvaccinated infected people who are not observed, the lower the estimate of observed effectiveness; and the lower the true effectiveness, the larger the gap between observed effectiveness and true effectiveness. Simulation case 3 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.2, the ongoing VR of 0.2, the completed VR of 0.6 and an average infection rate of 2% for the variant virus. Simulation finds that the higher the proportion of unobserved completed vaccination patients who are not infected, the lower the estimate of observed effectiveness; and the lower the true effectiveness, the larger the gap between observed effectiveness and true effectiveness. Simulation case 4 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.2, the ongoing VR of 0.2, the completed VR of 0.6 and an average infection rate of 5% for the variant virus. If a vaccine is more than 90% effectiveness against the premutant virus, but only 80% effectiveness against the mutant virus, and because 80% of the infected people with complete vaccination are not observed, the observed effectiveness of the vaccine is 91.95%, similar to case 1, it will lead to the wrong judgement that the VE against the variant virus is not decreased. CONCLUSION: Compared with traditional epidemiological investigation, this system can meet the challenges of accelerating virus variation and a large number of asymptomatic people, dynamically monitor and accurately evaluate the effectiveness of listed vaccines and maximise personal privacy without locking down the relevant area or city. This system established in this study could serve as a universal template for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 listed vaccines in cities around the world. If this system can be promoted globally, it will promote countries to strengthen unity and cooperation and enhance the global ability to respond to COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

REACH-HF is an effective and cost-effective 12-week home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme for patients with heart failure. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In 2019, four early adopter 'Beacon Sites' were set up to deliver REACH-HF to 200 patients. In 2020, 5 online REACH-HF training events were attended by 85 healthcare professionals from 45 National Health Service (NHS) teams across the UK and Ireland. DESIGN: Our mixed-methods study used in-depth semi-structured interviews and an online survey. Interviews were conducted with staff trained specifically for the Beacon Site project, identified by opportunity and snowball sampling. The online survey was later offered to subsequent NHS staff who took part in the online REACH-HF training. Normalisation Process Theory was used as a theoretical framework to guide data collection/analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen healthcare professionals working at the Beacon Sites were interviewed and 17 survey responses were received (20% response rate). The identified barriers and enablers included, among many, a lack of resources/commissioning, having interest in heart failure and working closely with the clinical heart failure team. Different implementation contexts (urban/rural), timing (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and factors outside the healthcare team/system (quality of the REACH-HF training) were observed to negatively or positively impact the implementation process. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are highly relevant to healthcare professionals involved in planning, delivering and commissioning of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with heart failure.

DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Denmark, 1 January 2021 to 26 March 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-65 years who received a heterologous vaccine schedule of priming with ChAdOx1-S and one or two mRNA booster doses (with either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine) were compared with adults who received a homologous BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine schedule (ie, two dose v two dose, and three dose v three dose schedule). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of hospital contacts for a range of adverse cardiovascular and haemostatic events within 28 days after the second or third vaccine dose, comparing heterologous versus homologous vaccine schedules. Secondary outcomes included additional prioritised adverse events of special interest. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios with adjustment for selected covariates. RESULTS: Individuals who had had a heterologous primary vaccine (n=137 495) or a homologous vaccine (n=2 688 142) were identified, in addition to those who had had a heterologous booster (n=129 770) or a homologous booster (n=2 197 213). Adjusted incidence rate ratios of adverse cardiovascular and haemostatic events within 28 days for the heterologous primary and booster vaccine schedules in comparison with the homologous mRNA vaccine schedules were 1.22 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.91) and 1.00 (0.58 to 1.72) for ischaemic cardiac events, 0.74 (0.40 to 1.34) and 0.72 (0.37 to 1.42) for cerebrovascular events, 1.12 (0.13 to 9.58) and 4.74 (0.94 to 24.01) for arterial thromboembolisms, 0.79 (0.45 to 1.38) and 1.09 (0.60 to 1.98) for venous thromboembolisms, 0.84 (0.18 to 3.96) and 1.04 (0.60 to 4.55) for myocarditis or pericarditis, 0.97 (0.45 to 2.10) and 0.89 (0.21 to 3.77) for thrombocytopenia and coagulative disorders, and 1.39 (1.01 to 1.91) and 1.02 (0.70 to 1.47) for other bleeding events, respectively. No associations with any of the outcomes were found when restricting to serious adverse events defined as stay in hospital for more than 24 h. CONCLUSION: Heterologous primary and booster covid-19 vaccine schedules of ChAdOx1-S priming and mRNA booster doses as both second and third doses were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events compared with homologous mRNA vaccine schedules.

DESIGN: Living evidence syntheses and review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 6 October 2020 to 10 January 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to 13 January 2021). One reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine learning program to prioritise records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Large (>10 000 participants) or population based or multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination; case series (n>/=5, presentation, short term clinical course and longer term outcomes); opinions, letters, reviews, and primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesised mechanisms. RESULTS: 46 studies were included (14 on incidence, seven on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short term course, three on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines was highest in male adolescents and male young adults (age 12-17 years, range 50-139 cases per million (low certainty); 18-29 years, 28-147 per million (moderate certainty)). For girls and boys aged 5-11 years and women aged 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) could be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). Incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine had very low certainty evidence. For individuals of 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12-17, 18-29, or 18-39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine for covid-19 might be lower when administered >/=31 days compared with </=30 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18-29 years indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to >/=56 days to substantially drop myocarditis or pericarditis incidence. For clinical course and short term outcomes, only one small case series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In adolescents and adults, most (>90%) myocarditis cases involved men of a median 20-30 years of age and with symptom onset two to four days after a second dose (71-100%). Most people were admitted to hospital (>/=84%) for a short duration (two to four days). For pericarditis, data were limited but more variation than myocarditis has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing, and rate of admission to hospital. Three case series with longer term (3 months; n=38) follow-up suggested persistent echocardiogram abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms or a need for drug treatments or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. Sixteen hypothesised mechanisms were described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that adolescent and young adult men are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Use of a Pfizer vaccine over a Moderna vaccine and waiting for more than 30 days between doses might be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 years is very rare but certainty was low. Data for clinical risk factors were very limited. A clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appeared to be benign, although longer term follow-up data were limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (eg, biopsy and tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism.", "CI": ["(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recent studies have shown that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to a high prevalence of behavioural sleep problems in the general population. This study aimed to provide two pictures of two different time points of the pandemic regarding the prevalence of sleep problems in adolescents and their association with psychological health variables. Two different independent large samples of Italian adolescents aged 13-17 years were recruited at two pandemic time points. A total of 1,146 adolescents at Time 1 (T1; April 2020) and 1,406 at Time 2 (T2; April 2021) took part in the study. Measures of insomnia symptoms, sleep hygiene, chronotype, psychological distress and emotion regulation were collected. Prevalence of insomnia was 12.13% at T1 and 23.19% at T2. Furthermore, high levels of poor sleep habits (late bedtime, poor sleep hygiene, use of electronic devices at bedtime) were also detected at both time points. Insomnia symptoms strongly correlated with poor sleep hygiene, higher psychological distress, and emotional suppression at both time points. Results highlighted an alarming picture for two large samples at two different time points of the pandemic that showed a potential negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in both the first outbreak and in the later phase of the pandemic, on sleep habits, psychological distress and insomnia symptoms in adolescents. This strongly suggests the need for monitoring these variables and their interaction in the post-pandemic period and to develop and promote interventions for insomnia and circadian disturbances during adolescence.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 European Sleep Research Society."], "FAU": ["Bacaro, Valeria", "Meneo, Debora", "Curati, Sara", "Buonanno, Carlo", "De Bartolo, Paola", "Riemann, Dieter", "Mancini, Francesco", "Martoni, Monica", "Baglioni, Chiara"], "AU": ["Bacaro V", "Meneo D", "Curati S", "Buonanno C", "De Bartolo P", "Riemann D", "Mancini F", "Martoni M", "Baglioni C"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2376-3513", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1968-6220"], "AD": ["Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.", "Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Association of Cognitive Psychology, School of Cognitive Psychotherapy, Rome, Italy.", "Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychophysiology/Sleep, Medicine, Centre for Mental Disorders, University Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany.", "Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Association of Cognitive Psychology, School of Cognitive Psychotherapy, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.", "Human Sciences Department, University of Rome Guglielmo Marconi Rome, Rome, Italy.", "Association of Cognitive Psychology, School of Cognitive Psychotherapy, Rome, Italy.", "Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychophysiology/Sleep, Medicine, Centre for Mental Disorders, University Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "England", "TA": "J Sleep Res", "JT": "Journal of sleep research", "JID": "9214441", "SB": "IM", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "adolescents", "health", "insomnia", "psychology", "sleep"], "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 19:42"], "PHST": ["2022/06/07 00:00 [revised]", "2022/02/28 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/19 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/13 19:42 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1111/jsr.13689 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "J Sleep Res. 2022 Jul 13. doi: 10.1111/jsr.13689."}, {"PMID": "35830965", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220713", "IS": "1080-6059 (Electronic) 1080-6040 (Linking)", "VI": "28", "IP": "9", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "Susceptibility of Wild Canids to SARS-CoV-2.", "LID": "10.3201/eid2809.220223 [doi]", "AB": "We assessed 2 wild canid species, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and coyotes (Canis latrans), for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

The World Health Organization recommends social isolation as a way of minimizing the risk of contagion of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of older adults and to investigate how anthropometric, functional, and clinical aspects are associated with this process. METHODS: Fifty healthy older adults were followed-up during 5 months. The subjects had their physical and mental health assessed during social isolation (pre-vaccine situation) and after the opening of stores and activities in the municipality (post-vaccine situation). Physical evaluation was performed using the 30-s sit and stand test. Participants' mental health was assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Loneliness Index. In this methodological design, muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and loneliness index were subject to pre-post analyses. In addition, these variables were included as outcomes in linear regression models. Participants' anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors were included as predictors of the statistical model. RESULTS: Participants' scores at baseline were consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscle strength of the subjects was appropriate to their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined, but with statistical significance only for depressive symptoms (p = 0.017, effect size of 0.11). Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained 42.8% of depressive symptoms, 22.3% of loneliness, and 30.2% of muscle strength in the elderly. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Older adults presented baseline scores consistent with mild depressive symptoms and low loneliness. The muscular strength of the subjects was appropriate for their ages. After 5 months of social isolation, all variables declined. Anthropometric, functional, and clinical factors explained a substantial part of the depressive symptoms, loneliness, and muscular strength in the elderly.

We evaluated whether bLF can prevent viral infections in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. To assess antiviral responses, we measured the levels of interferon (IFN) expression, IFN-stimulated gene expression, and infection with a pseudotyped virus bearing either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein after treatment of cells with both bLF and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, an analog of double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection. Combination treatment of cells with both bLF and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid increased mRNA and protein expression of several IFN genes (IFNB, IFN L1, and IFNL2) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG15, MX1, IFITM1, and IFITM3) in Caco-2 cells. However, treatment with bLF alone did not induce an antiviral response. Furthermore, combination treatment suppressed infection of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus more efficiently than did bLF treatment alone, even though combination treatment increased mRNA expression of ACE2.

Reports on the effect of COVID-19-associated restrictions on sexual behaviors have been mixed, but STI transmissions have continued during the pandemic. We sought to understand the pandemic impact on sexual habits associated with STIs among IWantTheKit (IWTK) users. METHODS: Users of IWTK, a free, on-line STI testing platform, were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe survey responses. Associations with reports of new sex partnerships were explored as a marker of STI risk. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze individual characteristics and reported behaviors associated with self-reported new sexual partnerships during the first two COVID-19 pandemic waves. RESULTS: Of the 3,462 users of the on-line STI testing platform between June 2020 and February 2021, 1,088 (31.4%) completed the on-line survey; 705 (66.2%) of 1,065 reported a new sex partner. One-quarter met their sex partners using Apps. Overall, 10% were symptomatic and almost 18% were concerned that their partner had an STI. White race in males (OR 1.81 [95%CI:1.04, 3.16]), female age < 25 years (OR 1.85 [95%CI:1.09, 3.14]), and increased condom use in both men and women were significantly associated with reports of new sexual partnerships in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic restrictions on social gatherings, new sexual partnerships were common in this population, associated with common risk factors, and may help to explain ongoing STI transmission.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association.

COVID-19 exacerbated the challenges in treating and preventing new C. trachomatis (CT) infections. This study examined the impact of COVID-19 on treating CT-positive patients discharged from a safety-net women's emergency unit. METHODS: This was a pre and post retrospective cohort study. CT-positive females seen in the women's emergency unit were evaluated. Patients discharged in 2019, the 'pre-COVID-19' group, and those discharged in 2020, the 'COVID-19' group were compared. The primary outcome was CT treatment within 30 days and secondary outcomes included prescription dispensation, repeat tests taken, and expedited partner treatment (EPT). A sub-group of patients discharged prior to treatment who entered a nurse-led follow-up program were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 1,357 cases included, there were no differences in successful 30-day treatment (709/789(89.9%) vs. 568/511(89.9%), p = 0.969) or repeat positive CT test (74/333(22.2%) vs. 46/211(21.8%), p = 0.36) between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19. However, the patients who picked up their prescription (196/249(78.7%) vs. 180/206(87.4%), p = 0.021) and those who were prescribed EPT (156/674(23.1%) vs. 292/460(63.5%), p < 0.001) increased. Findings in the sub-group of patients who entered the follow-up program were consistent with those in the full cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic did not change treatment patterns of CT positive patients in this safety-net women's emergency unit. However, patients were more likely to pick up their medications during COVID-19. Despite the perseverance of these programs through the pandemic, most patients are discharged prior to positive results and a fair amount remain untreated.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Evidence also supports that COVID-19 pneumonia only accounts for a part of COVID-19 related deaths. RESULTS: This disease is indeed characterized by abnormal inflammatory response and vascular dysfunction, leading to the involvement and failure of different systems, including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulopathy, myocardial damage and renal failure. Inflammation and vascular dysfunction are also well-known features of hyperglycemia and diabetes, making up the ground for a detrimental synergistic combination that could explain the increased mortality observed in hyperglycemic patients. In this work, we conduct a narrative review on this intriguing connection. Together with this, we also present the clinical characteristics, outcomes, laboratory and histopathological findings related to this topic of a cohort of nearly 1000 subjects with COVID-19 admitted to a third-level Hospital in Milan. CONCLUSION: We found an increased mortality in subjects with COVID-19 and diabetes, together with an altered inflammatory profile; this may support the hypothesis that diabetes and COVID-19 meet at the crossroads of inflammation and vascular dysfunction.", "CI": ["This article is protected by copyright.

This has resulted in the need to identify patients that can be discharged early before full clinical recovery. We designed this study to determine if in changes routine tests like CBCD and CRP can be a useful complement to clinical status when deciding to discharge patients from ICU. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in Rafic Hariri University Hospital. Levels of biomarkers measured at admission (T1) and within 3 days of outcome (T2) were collected and ratios (T2/T1) were calculated. The Odds Ratios of association between the changes in these biomarkers and outcome were estimated. Multivariate analysis and AUC for the performance of these biomarkers were also conducted. RESULTS: We found on multivariate analysis that reduction in counts of lymphocyte and platelets and elevation in counts of neutrophils and level of CRP (T2/T1 ratio > 1) are strongly associated with mortality with respective ORs estimated at 6.74, 3.26, 5.65 and 4.34 [p-values < 0.001]. AUCs were found to lie in a range of 0.68 to 0.81 indicating fair to good performance. Other factors found to impact survival were AKI, AF and ACS [p-values < 0.01]. In contrast to other studies, risk factors didn't show an association with survival when adjusted for effects of complications and changes in biomarker levels.

Quantitative estimation of the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples could help physicians make decisions on clinical treatment and patient management. Here, we propose to use a quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) method to evaluate the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in samples. We used threshold time (TT) values of qLAMP, the isothermal incubation time required for the fluorescent or colorimetric signal to reach the threshold, to indicate the viral load of clinical samples. Similar to the cycle threshold (Ct ) values in conventional qPCR, TT values of qLAMP show a linear relationship to the copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2. The higher the viral loadings, the lower qLAMP TT values are. The RT-qLAMP assay was demonstrated to quantify the viral loads of synthesized full-length RNA, inactivated viral particles (BBIBP-CorV), and clinical samples within 15 min by fluorescent reading and 25 min by colorimetric reading. The RT-qLAMP has been applied to detect Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Delta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the human beta-actin gene, and their TT values showed the linear patterns. The RT-qLAMP assays were evaluated by 64 clinical samples (25 positives and 39 negatives) for the assessment of viral loads, and it was also used to quantify the human beta-actin gene, which was used as a control and an indicator of sampling quality in clinical swab samples.

The aim of this study was i) to determine the proportion of people with mental stability and volatility during the pandemic in a North West England city region sample and ii) to establish group differences in psychosocial variables. Mental stability and volatility refer to the extent to which individuals reported change in levels of common mental health symptoms over the course of 12 weeks. No change in mental health over the 12 weeks reflected mental stability whilst change in mental health reflected mental volatility. METHOD: A two-wave-online survey (N = 163) was used to explore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic on relatively disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the region. The data collected represents 12 weeks of individual pandemic experience between mid-June and mid-December 2020. A three-level composite common mental health change variable was created combining self-reported anxiety and depression to group stable, volatile, and very volatile individuals in terms of the changeability of their mental health. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc tests were used to determine how people with mental stability and volatility differed on factors categorised within an ecological framework of resilience (individual, community, societal, and COVID-19 specific). RESULTS: Individuals categorised as 'stable' in terms of mental health symptoms (63.6%) had better mental and physical health; were more tolerant of uncertainty; and reported higher levels of resilience and wellbeing compared to 'very volatile' people (19.8%). These individuals also reported feeling less socially isolated, experienced a greater sense of belonging to their community which was more likely to fulfil their needs, and were more likely to have access to green space nearby for their recommended daily exercise. 'Stable' individuals did not report worrying any more during the pandemic than usual and tolerated uncertainty better compared to those in the 'volatile' group. IMPLICATIONS: The majority of participants in this sample were mentally stable and coping well with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The resilience of these individuals was related to key place-based factors such as a strong sense of community and useable local assets. The data showcase the role of place-based social determinants in supporting resilience and thereby highlight key preventative measures for public mental health during times of international crisis.", "FAU": ["Ujhelyi Gomez, Katalin", "Corcoran, Rhiannon", "Ring, Adele", "Hassan, Shaima", "Abba, Katherine", "Downing, Jennifer", "Goodall, Mark", "Gabbay, Mark", "Clarke, Pam", "Moran, Paul", "Obe, Dorcas Akeju", "Bennett, Kate M"], "AU": ["Ujhelyi Gomez K", "Corcoran R", "Ring A", "Hassan S", "Abba K", "Downing J", "Goodall M", "Gabbay M", "Clarke P", "Moran P", "Obe DA", "Bennett KM"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1396-9588", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4880-998X"], "AD": ["Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Primary Care & Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Public Advisor at the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Public Advisor at the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.", "Department of Psychology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["Anxiety/epidemiology", "*COVID-19/epidemiology", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Pandemics", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "PMC": "PMC9278749", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 13:43"], "PHST": ["2022/03/14 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/26 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/13 13:43 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0266153 [doi]", "PONE-D-22-07538 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 13;17(7):e0266153. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0266153. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35830439", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220715", "LR": "20220716", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "Modeling the initial phase of COVID-19 epidemic: The role of age and disease severity in the Basque Country, Spain.", "PG": "e0267772", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0267772 [doi]", "AB": "Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the globe.

COVID-19 symptoms range from mild (or no) symptoms to severe illness, with disease severity and death occurring according to a hierarchy of risks, with age and pre-existing health conditions enhancing risks of disease severity. In order to understand the dynamics of disease severity during the initial phase of the pandemic, we propose a modeling framework stratifying the studied population into two groups, older and younger, assuming different risks for severe disease manifestation. The deterministic and the stochastic models are parametrized using epidemiological data for the Basque Country population referring to confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, from February to the end of March 2020. Using similar parameter values, both models were able to describe well the existing data. A detailed sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the key parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the population. We observed that the population younger than 60 years old of age would contribute more to the overall force of infection than the older population, as opposed to the already existing age-structured models, opening new ways to understand the effect of population age on disease severity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among these phytochemicals, epigallocatechin gallate, a polyphenol and a major component of green tea, could effectively inhibit the interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein and the human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Alternately, in silico molecular docking studies of epigallocatechin gallate and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 indicated a binding score of -7.8 kcal/mol and identified a hydrogen bond between R393 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is considered as a key interacting residue involved in binding with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, suggesting the possible blocking of interaction between receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Such roosts are constantly under threat, even more so after the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the importance of such roosts, there is no detailed understanding of what makes temples favorable for bats and the critical factors for their persistence. Here we relate temple microhabitat characteristics and land use around ancient temples (>400 years) to bat species richness and abundance in the Tamiraparani river basin of south India. Temples were selected for sampling along the river basin based on logistics and permission to access them. We counted bats at the roost in the mornings and late afternoons from inside the temples. Temple characteristics such as dark rooms, walkways, crevices, towers, and disturbances to the roosts were recorded. Based on European Space Agency land use classifications, we recorded land use such as crops, trees, scrub, grassland, urban areas, and water availability within a 5 km radius of the temple. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to relate the counts in temples with microhabitats and land use. We sampled 59 temples repeatedly across 5 years which yielded a sample of 246 survey events. The total number of bats counted was 20,211, of which Hipposideros speoris was the most common (9,715), followed by Rousettus leschenaultii (5,306), Taphozous melanopogon (3,196), Megaderma lyra (1,497), Tadarida aegyptiaca (303), Pipistrellus sp. (144) and Rhinopoma hardwickii (50). About 39% of the total bats occurred in dark rooms and 51% along walkways. Species richness and total abundance were related to the availability of dark rooms and the number of buildings in the temple. Land use elements only had a weak effect, but scrub and grassland, even though they were few, are critical for bats. We conclude that retaining undisturbed dark rooms with small exits in temples and other dimly lit areas and having natural areas around temples are vital for bat conservation.", "FAU": ["Ganesh, T", "Saravanan, A", "Mathivanan, M"], "AU": ["Ganesh T", "Saravanan A", "Mathivanan M"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1327-0347", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4827-5508"], "AD": ["Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Royal Enclave, Bangalore, Karnataka state, India.", "Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Royal Enclave, Bangalore, Karnataka state, India.", "Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Royal Enclave, Bangalore, Karnataka state, India."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["Agriculture", "Animals", "*COVID-19", "*Chiroptera", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Trees"], "PMC": "PMC9278754", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 13:43"], "PHST": ["2021/04/27 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/21 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/13 13:43 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0251771 [doi]", "PONE-D-21-13889 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 13;17(7):e0251771. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0251771. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35830424", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220715", "LR": "20220716", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "Fear of COVID-19 infection and related factors in Japan: A comparison of college students, pregnant women, hospital nurses and the general public.", "PG": "e0271176", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0271176 [doi]", "AB": "The fear of COVID-19 has become a social problem during the pandemic. The present study compares the fear of COVID-19 among members of the general public, college students, pregnant women, and hospital nurses. It also examines various factors associated with the fear of COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a survey of the general public on fear of infection and related factors and compared from previous studies of college students, pregnant women, and hospital nurses. A crowdsourced survey was administered to 450 members of the general public, who were asked about their fear of COVID-19 infection. Data from college students, nurses, and pregnant women were recruited from a May-June 2020 survey on fear of COVID-19. An analysis of variance was used to compare the fear of infection among different attribution. The results showed that more pregnant women and fewer college students feared infection, as did equal numbers of hospital nurses and members of the general public. The multiple regression analysis revealed that college students and pregnant women associated the fear of infection with their key source of information, while hospital nurses associated the fear of infection with living with an older person. These results suggest that pregnant women have a significant fear of infection, which is further defined by the risk of serious illness in cases of infection. Although the fear of infection is relatively low among hospital nurses, they fear becoming a source of infection. These results reveal the groups in Japan that fear infection and the reasons for their concern.

Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the nonlinear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this article, we propose a deep learning-based image SR architecture in the Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a customized Tchebichef convolutional layer (TCL). The role of TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the transform mentioned earlier is achieved using another layer known as the inverse TCL (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of SR simplified. Furthermore, a transfer learning-based approach is adopted to enhance the quality of images by considering Covid19 medical images as an additional experiment. It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality that may help in clinical diagnosis. Experimental results obtained using the proposed Tchebichef transform domain SR (TTDSR) architecture provides competitive results when compared with most of the deep learning methods employed using a fewer number of trainable parameters.", "FAU": ["Kumar, Ahlad", "Singh, Harsh Vardhan", "Khare, Vijeta"], "AU": ["Kumar A", "Singh HV", "Khare V"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst", "JT": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "JID": "101616214", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 13:34"], "PHST": ["2022/07/13 13:34 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3188452 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst. 2022 Jul 13;PP. doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3188452."}, {"PMID": "35830386", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220715", "LR": "20220716", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "A pilot study of the moderating effect of gender on the physical activity and fatigue severity among recovered COVID-19 patients.", "PG": "e0269954", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0269954 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: Clinical data point toward gender-based differences in COVID-19 severity. However, there is insufficient research examining whether gender predicts physical activity (PA) and fatigue severity in patients recovering from COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the PA and fatigue severity in a cohort of patients recovering from COVID-19 infection and measure the extent to which gender-based differences moderate the relationship of PA with fatigue. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sample comprised patients recovering from COVID-19 over at least 3 months. Recovered patients were stratified into two groups based on gender. The survey included items pertaining to sociodemographic, a fatigue severity scale and a self-reported international PA questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (44 women and 43 men) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with men, women reported sedentary behavior (70%) and high fatigue severity (64%). A significantly higher number of women had a low PA score compared with men (p = .002). The findings indicated that gender significantly moderates the effect of total PA in metabolic equivalents (METs; min/wk) on fatigue severity [F = 4.8, p = .03, DeltaR2 = 0.24]. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that women might be at risk of higher fatigue severity, in addition to engaging less in PA. Physical activity may plays a significant role in modulate the fatigue severity. Consequently, interventions aimed at promoting physical activity in women stand high chances of addressing the disparity in the distribution of prevalence of fatigue between men and women.", "FAU": ["Aldhahi, Monira I", "Alshehri, Mohammed M", "Alqahtani, Faleh", "Alqahtani, Abdulfattah Saeed"], "AU": ["Aldhahi MI", "Alshehri MM", "Alqahtani F", "Alqahtani AS"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5255-4860"], "AD": ["Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.", "Physical Therapy Department, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.", "Medical Research Center, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.", "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.", "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "PLoS One", "JT": "PloS one", "JID": "101285081", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/epidemiology", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Fatigue/epidemiology/etiology", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Pilot Projects", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "PMC": "PMC9278785", "COIS": ["The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."], "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 13:33"], "PHST": ["2022/01/21 00:00 [received]", "2022/05/31 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/13 13:33 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0269954 [doi]", "PONE-D-22-02079 [pii]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "PLoS One. 2022 Jul 13;17(7):e0269954. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0269954. eCollection 2022."}, {"PMID": "35830382", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220715", "LR": "20220716", "IS": "1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)", "VI": "17", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022", "TI": "To Zoom or not to Zoom: A longitudinal study of UK population's activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "PG": "e0270207", "LID": "10.1371/journal.pone.0270207 [doi]", "AB": "This longitudinal study determines the frequency and way of people doing activities from Spring 2020 to Summer 2021 during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Six online surveys were carried out between April 2020 and July 2021. 4,992 participants were engaged in the cross-sectional study and 203 participants who provided repeat responses were included in the subset sample of prospective cohort analysis. Primary outcomes measured were the frequency and the mode of doing the activities (online or in-person) across sixteen selected activity groups, as defined by the UK National Time Use Survey. The results show that cultural activities, spending time with others, and travelling, were the activities with the largest proportions of frequency and mode changes. The most significant changes occurred from March to June 2020, a period that included the first lockdown. Survey results from this period show a significant decrease among most of the sixteen measured activities. From March to October 2020, a period which spans the first lockdown and its subsequent ease of restrictions, showed the most significant shift from accessing activities in-person to online. Despite 'Freedom Day', the July 19th 2021 date in which all restrictions were abolished, it was found that people do cultural activities and group activities at a significantly lower frequency than before the pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate hepatic and pancreatic density alterations on computed tomography (CT) and to analyze whether these alterations had a relationship with chest CT score and laboratory findings. METHODS: Patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 from March 11, 2020, to February 6, 2021, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into nonprogressive and progressive groups according to their chest CT scores. Liver and pancreas density, and liver-to-spleen (L/S) ratio were calculated. Laboratory findings, medication, intensive care unit stay, and survival were noted. RESULTS: There were 51 patients in the nonprogressive group and 123 patients in the progressive group. The median (minimum to maximum) L/S value of the nonprogressive group was 1 (0.28-1.53) at admission and 1.06 (0.33-1.83) at follow-up (P < 0.001). In the progressive group, the median L/S value was 1.08 (0.35-1.51) at admission and 0.92 (0.33-1.75) at follow-up (P < 0.001). A significant difference was found between the 2 groups at admission and follow-up (P = 0.010 and P < 0.001, respectively). Pancreatic density measured at follow-up was significantly lower in the progressive group (P = 0.045). In the progressive group, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatinine, urea, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and white blood cell values were higher; albumin and lymphocyte values were lower (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 with progressive CT scores may have a decrease in L/S values, and their pancreatic density is lower than nonprogressives.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine-among cohorts exposed to the early COVID-19 pandemic-whether observed counts of overall, early and moderately preterm birth fell outside the expected range. METHODS: We used de-identified, cross-sectional, national birth certificate data from 2014 to 2020. We used month and year of birth and gestational age to estimate month of conception for birth. We calculated the count of overall (<37 weeks gestation), early (<33 weeks gestation) and moderately (33 to <37 weeks gestation) preterm birth by month of conception. We employed time series methods to estimate expected counts of preterm birth for exposed conception cohorts and identified cohorts for whom the observed counts of preterm birth fell outside the 95% detection interval of the expected value. RESULTS: Among the 23,731,146 births in our study, the mean prevalence of preterm birth among monthly conception cohorts was 9.7 per 100 live births. Gestations conceived in July, August or December of 2019-that is exposed to the early COVID-19 pandemic in the first or third trimester-yielded approximately 3245 fewer moderately preterm and 3627 fewer overall preterm births than the expected values for moderate and overall preterm.

Herein, we developed a label-free and low-background reporter for CRISPR/Cas12a signaling by integrating DNA-templated copper nanoclusters (DNA-CuNCs) and exonuclease I (EXO I). The template of the DNA-CuNCs was rationally designed as a ds-/ss-DNA hybrid, ensuring that after a quick and nonpersistent cut of Cas12a, a majority of the template can be digested by EXO I. Based on this novel reporter, a biosensor termed CRISPR-CNS (cost-effective, nimble, and sensitive copper nanocluster sensor integrating CRISPR) was developed. Due to the high signal-to-background ratio of our proposed reporter, CRISPR-CNS shows excellent performances for nucleic acid detection, yielding a detection limit of 20 copies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

It has been months since emergency use of pediatric COVID-19 vaccine was approved, we reviewed the prevalence and transmission of COVID-19 in children. The prevalence of COVID-19 in children is reduced due to vaccination even in a Delta prevalent period, so an increase in the vaccination rate is needed in children. Although the precise role of children in the transmission requires more research to uncover, they likely played a significant role, according to the available literature. We also described four candidate COVID-19 vaccines for children on their safety and immunogenicity and the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants on childhood vaccination. Safety issues on pediatric vaccines post-approval, like adverse events following immunization and adverse events of special interest, require long-term and effective regulatory mechanisms to make sure.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer,", "Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license."], "FAU": ["Zhang, Peng", "Wei, Mingwei", "Jin, Pengfei", "Li, Zhuopei", "Li, Jingxin", "Zhu, Fengcai"], "AU": ["Zhang P", "Wei M", "Jin P", "Li Z", "Li J", "Zhu F"], "AD": ["Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "NHC Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "NHC Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "NHC Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "NHC Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.", "Institute of Global Public Health and Emergency Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "China", "TA": "Chin Med J (Engl)", "JT": "Chinese medical journal", "JID": "7513795", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 11:55"], "PHST": ["2021/11/13 00:00 [received]", "2022/07/13 11:55 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["10.1097/CM9.0000000000002169 [doi]", "00029330-990000000-00030 [pii]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Chin Med J (Engl). 2022 Jul 14. pii: 00029330-990000000-00030. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000002169."}, {"PMID": "35830239", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "PubMed-not-MEDLINE", "LR": "20220714", "IS": "1929-0748 (Print) 1929-0748 (Linking)", "VI": "11", "IP": "7", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "An Integrated Care Platform System (C3-Cloud) for Care Planning, Decision Support, and Empowerment of Patients With Multimorbidity: Protocol for a Technology Trial.", "PG": "e21994", "LID": "10.2196/21994 [doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need to organize the care around the patient and not the disease, while considering the complex realities of multiple physical and psychosocial conditions, and polypharmacy. Integrated patient-centered care delivery platforms have been developed for both patients and clinicians. These platforms could provide a promising way to achieve a collaborative environment that improves the provision of integrated care for patients via enhanced information and communication technology solutions for semiautomated clinical decision support. OBJECTIVE: The Collaborative Care and Cure Cloud project (C3-Cloud) has developed 2 collaborative computer platforms for patients and members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and deployed these in 3 different European settings. The objective of this study is to pilot test the platforms and evaluate their impact on patients with 2 or more chronic conditions (diabetes mellitus type 2, heart failure, kidney failure, depression), their informal caregivers, health care professionals, and, to some extent, health care systems. METHODS: This paper describes the protocol for conducting an evaluation of user experience, acceptability, and usefulness of the platforms. For this, 2 \"testing and evaluation\" phases have been defined, involving multiple qualitative methods (focus groups and surveys) and advanced impact modeling (predictive modeling and cost-benefit analysis). Patients and health care professionals were identified and recruited from 3 partnering regions in Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom via electronic health record screening. RESULTS: The technology trial in this 4-year funded project (2016-2020) concluded in April 2020. The pilot technology trial for evaluation phases 3 and 4 was launched in November 2019 and carried out until April 2020. Data collection for these phases is completed with promising results on platform acceptance and socioeconomic impact. We believe that the phased, iterative approach taken is useful as it involves relevant stakeholders at crucial stages in the platform development and allows for a sound user acceptance assessment of the final product. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with multiple chronic conditions often experience shortcomings in the care they receive. It is hoped that personalized care plan platforms for patients and collaboration platforms for members of MDTs can help tackle the specific challenges of clinical guideline reconciliation for patients with multimorbidity and improve the management of polypharmacy. The initial evaluative phases have indicated promising results of platform usability. Results of phases 3 and 4 were methodologically useful, yet limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

[doi]", "AB": "BACKGROUND: During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for future public health crises, it is important to understand the relationship between individuals' health beliefs, including their trust in various sources of health information, and their engagement in mitigation behaviors. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify relationships between trust in various sources of health information and the behavioral beliefs related to vaccination and mask wearing as well as to understand how behavioral beliefs related to vaccination differ by willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 1034 adults in the United States and assessed their trust in federal, local, and media sources of health information; their beliefs about vaccination; and their masking intention and vaccination willingness. RESULTS: Using regression, masking intention was predicted by trust in the World Health Organization (P<.05) and participants' state public health offices (P<.05), while vaccine willingness was predicted by trust in participants' own health care providers (P<.05) and pharmaceutical companies (P<.001). Compared to individuals with low willingness to be vaccinated, individuals with high willingness indicated greater endorsement of beliefs that vaccines would support a return to normalcy, are safe, and are a social responsibility (P<.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Results can be used to inform ongoing public health messaging campaigns to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and increase readiness for the next pandemic. Additionally, results support the need to bolster the public's trust in health care agencies as well as to enhance trust and respect in health care providers to increase people's adoption of mitigation behaviors.", "CI": ["(c)Bridget L Hanson, Kari Finley, Jay Otto, Nicholas J Ward.

The same immune impairment accompanying CLL and MM also affects suboptimal vaccine response. The study assessed the effectiveness of the humoral and T cell-mediated immunity following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (using either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) in short-term (2-5 weeks after 2(nd) dose) and long-term follow-up (12 weeks after vaccination). Between March and August 2021, blood samples were obtained from 62 CLL and 60 MM patients from eight different hematology departments in Poland. Total anti-RBD antibodies were detected in 37% MM patients before vaccination, increased to 91% and 94% in short- and long-term follow-up, respectively. In CLL, serological responses were detectable in 21% of patients before vaccination and increased to 45% in the short-term and 71% in long-term observation. We detected a tendency to higher frequencies of specific CD8+ T cells against SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination compared to samples before vaccination in MM patients and no changes in frequencies of specific T cells in CLL patients. This study provides novel insights into mRNA vaccination efficacy in immunocompromised MM and CLL patients, and our findings highlight that specific CD8+ T cells against SARS-CoV-2 might be induced by vaccination but do not correlate positively with serological responses.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol tablets in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, controlled and multicenter investigator-initiated trial involving adult patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Patients were stratified 1:2 to either standard-of-care (SOC) or SOC plus arbidol tablets (oral administration of 200 mg per time, three times a day for 14 days). The primary endpoint was negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 within the first week. The rates and 95% confidential intervals were calculated for each variable. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled; 66 were assigned to the SOC plus arbidol tablets group, and 33 to the SOC group. The negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 within the first week in patients receiving arbidol tablets was significantly higher than that of the SOC group (70.3% [45/64] vs. 42.4% [14/33]; difference of conversion rate 27.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.7%-48.1%; P = 0.008). Compared to those in the SOC group, patients receiving arbidol tablets had a shorter duration of clinical recovery (median 7.0 days vs. 12.0 days; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.877, 95% CI: 1.151-3.060, P = 0.006), symptom of fever (median 3.0 days vs. 12.0 days; HR: 18.990, 95% CI: 5.350-67.410, P < 0.001), as well as hospitalization (median 12.5 days vs. 20.0 days; P < 0.001). Moreover, the addition of arbidol tablets to SOC led to more rapid normalization of declined blood lymphocytes (median 10.0 days vs. 14.5 days; P > 0.05). The most common adverse event in the arbidol tablets group was the elevation of transaminase (5/200, 2.5%), and no one withdrew from the study due to adverse events or disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: SOC plus arbidol tablets significantly increase the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 within the first week anas, accelerate the recovery of COVID-19 patients. During the treatment with arbidol tablets, we find no significant serious adverse events.

thrombosis (IDDVT), that is, thrombosis in infrapopliteal veins without proximal extension or pulmonary embolism (PE). Objective: To determine the clinical characteristics, short-term, and 1-year outcomes in patients with IDDVT and to compare the outcomes in unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses with patients who had proximal DVT. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, international cohort study in participating sites of the Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Tromboembolica (RIETE) registry conducted from March 1, 2001, through February 28, 2021. Patients included in this study had IDDVT. Patients with proximal DVT were identified for comparison. Patients were excluded if they had a history of asymptomatic DVT, upper-extremity DVT, coexisting PE, or COVID-19 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were 90-day and 1-year mortality, 1-year major bleeding, and 1-year venous thromboembolism (VTE) deterioration, which was defined as subsequent development of proximal DVT or PE. Results: A total of 33897 patients were identified with isolated DVT (without concomitant PE); 5938 (17.5%) had IDDVT (mean [SD] age, 61 [17] years; 2975 male patients [50.1%]), and 27959 (82.5%) had proximal DVT (mean [SD] age, 65 [18] years; 14315 male patients [51.2%]). Compared with individuals with proximal DVT, those with IDDVT had a lower comorbidity burden but were more likely to have had recent surgery or to have received hormonal therapy. Patients with IDDVT had lower risk of 90-day mortality compared with those with proximal DVT (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40-0.55). Findings were similar in 1-year unadjusted analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.46-0.59) and adjusted analyses (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82). Patients with IDDVT had a lower 1-year hazard of VTE deterioration (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99). In 1-year adjusted analyses of patients without an adverse event within the first 3 months, IDDVT was associated with lower risk of VTE deterioration (adjusted HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.97). By 1-year follow-up, symptoms or signs of postthrombotic syndrome were less common in patients with IDDVT (47.6% vs 60.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this cohort study suggest that patients with IDDVT had a less ominous prognosis compared with patients with proximal DVT. Such differences were likely multifactorial, including the differences in demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, particularly for all-cause mortality, and a potential association of thrombus location with VTE deterioration and postthrombotic syndrome.

outbreak of SARs-CoV-2 with emerging new variants is leading to global health crisis and has brought a major concern for patients with comorbidities. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor neurodegenerative disease involving various metabolic and psychological ailments along with the common occurrence of hyposmia as observed in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the observed surplus inflammatory responses in both diseases are also alarming. Alongside, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, essentially required by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell and dopamine decarboxylase (DDC), required for dopamine synthesis is known to co-regulate in the non-neuronal cells. Taken together, these conditions suggested the probable reciprocal pathological relation between COVID-19 and PD and also suggested that during comorbidities, the disease diagnosis and therapeutics are critical and may engender severe health complications. In this review, we discuss various events and mechanisms which may have implications for the exacerbation of PD conditions and must be taken into account during the treatment of patients.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

However, it is important to consider the patient's sociocultural environment. OBJECTIVE: To design and assessment of bilingual audiovisual material acceptability, by means of two social networks, for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the qom community in Argentina. METHODS: A qualitative study was performed in two stages: (1) audiovisual material design, development, and validation implementing a collaborative action research method. (2) Publishing of the material on two social networks at two different times. The selected topic was the coronavirus disease 2019 impact on patients with RA. A qualitative and quantitative data analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty subjects participated into the initial validation stage with a 70% acceptance rate. First, 28 subjects (70%) participated on Facebook and 25 (62.5%) joined the WhatsApp group. Then, the same number of subjects participated on Facebook, while only 45% of subjects participated on WhatsApp. Most of them participated using short phrases such as \"I like it.\" The 60% of the participants played the videos. However, less than 10% shared them. Videos in Spanish were the once most shared. Participation dramatically fell during the second time, and 40% of the WhatsApp subjects never participated. CONCLUSION: The strategies developed for this indigenous community were of no utility, probably because of socio-cultural, economic, and digital barriers. They should be designed and implemented identifying the target group and its environment. Key Points * Online education strategies should be designed with cultural sensitivity. * Technological barriers make digital inequality visible in vulnerable groups. * Educational interventions should have a collaborative design and they should be created together with the communities. * The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened inequalities in the health care and follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, especially between most socially and economically disadvantaged groups.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

Despite current knowledge, there is a lack of longitudinal studies evaluating this effect. To assess patients' perceptions about changes in lifestyle, and eating and sleeping patterns after 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify if aspects related to the pandemic (social distancing, COVID-19 infection, behavioral changes, and financial difficulties) are predictors of worsening in eating and sleeping parameters. METHODS: This was a longitudinal study that followed patients with diabetes from April 2020 to July 2021 in Southern Brazil. Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, aged >/= 18 years, were included. The outcome of this study was the assessment of daily habits during a 18-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific questionnaires were applied once participants were included in this study (3 months after the onset of the pandemic) and at the 18-month follow-up, which included the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), the Mini-Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ), and a specific questionnaire on diet, physical activity, and sleep pattern. Data were compared within and between groups (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), and multivariable models were used to identify subgroups of worse outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 118 (78.6%) participants remained in the study at follow-up (mean age 54.6 +/- 13.9 years, 41.3% male). In total, 33.9% of participants perceived weight gain during the pandemic, especially those with type 1 diabetes (43.1% vs 25.0% in type 2 diabetes, P = 0.04). About one in four participants reported emotional eating and changes in their eating habits for financial reasons. Regarding sleep patterns, more than half the participants reported taking naps during the day, out of which 30.5% of them perceived worse sleep quality, with no difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes groups. There were no within-group differences in MSQ and EAT-26 scores. Among participants with type 2 diabetes, age >/= 60 years (OR 27.6, 95%CI 2.2-345.7), diabetes duration >/= 15 years (OR 28.9, 95%CI 1.4-597.9), and perceived emotional eating (OR 10.9, 95%CI 1.1-107.5) were associated with worsened food quality. Worse sleep quality during the pandemic was associated with age >/= 60 years for both type 2 diabetes (OR 5.6, 95%CI 1.1-31.5) and type 1 diabetes (OR 5.5, 95%CI 1.0-29.9). CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up data from a cohort of patients with diabetes indicate that at the end of 18 months of social distancing, some lifestyle aspects worsened and some improved, showing that these patients responded differently to the adversities of this period. The evidence of clinical features associated with worsening in food and sleep quality provides new insights to prioritizing actions in crisis situations.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

However, in older adults, superadded infection may be common and require treatment. Our aim was to investigate the occurrence and outcomes from possible superadded infections, occurring within 2 weeks of hospitalization, in older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single centre, observational cohort study. We collected data from patients admitted to older adult wards who had tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus on viral PCR between 1st October and 1st December 2020. The primary outcome was inpatient death occurring within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. The secondary outcome was length of stay in hospital. Associations were described using univariable and multivariable models, and time to event data. RESULTS: Of 266 patients with COVID-19, 43% (115) had evidence of superadded infections (91 with positive bacterial cultures and 36 instances of radiological lobar consolidation).

Green bonds, corporate environmental responsibility, green technology investment, and the carbon trading market are our research objects to comprehensively understand the interaction among them, from both macro and micro perspectives. Considering the importance of temporal heterogeneity and spillover direction in causation, we employ the time-varying Granger causality method to obtain bidirectional real-time identification. We find that green market returns exhibit a time-varying bidirectional causality with EPU over most of the sample period. In contrast, green markets are more a risk spillover than a recipient. Notably, this causality is vulnerable to exogenous financial risks, especially structural changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This review looked at the literature on depression, for which there is a breadth of data, as well as other conditions that have historically not been as well studied, as well as attempting to provide practical recommendations for ECT practitioners. This review also examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ECT in the elderly. RECENT FINDINGS: ECT shows robust efficacy across many psychiatric diseases, from depression and bipolar disorder to psychosis and catatonia. It has also shown positive results at improving behavioral symptoms of dementia, as well as improving motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. It is routinely found to be a safe treatment as well, generally with only minimal transient side effects. ECT should not be considered a \"last-resort\" treatment for geriatric patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. It has historical and recent literature supporting its use in many psychiatric disorders and has been shown to be safe with minimal side effects when appropriate considerations are taken for the elderly population.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

We aimed to evaluate the influence of three unique messaging appeal framings of vaccination from two types of messengers on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in India. We surveyed 534 online participants in India using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) from December 2021 through January 2022. We assessed participants' perception of three messaging appeals of vaccination - COVID-19 disease health outcomes, social norms related to vaccination, and economic impact of COVID-19 - from two messengers, healthcare providers (HCP) and peers. Using a multivariable multinomial logistic regression, we examined participants' ad preference and vaccine hesitancy. Participants expressed a high level of approval for all of the ads, with >80% positive responses for all questions across ads. Overall ads delivered by health care workers were preferred by a majority of participants in our study (n = 381, 71.4%). Ad preference ranged from 3.6% (n = 19) social norm/peer ad to 32.4% (n = 173) health outcome/HCP ad and half of participants preferred the health outcome ad (n = 279, 52.3%). Additionally, vaccine hesitancy was not related to preference (p = .513): HCP vs. peer ads (p = .522); message type (p = .284). The results suggest that all three appeals tested were generally acceptable, as well as the two messenger types, although preference was for the health care provider messenger and health outcome appeal.

METHODS: The ECMOSARS registry included COVID-19 patients supported by ECMO in France. We analyzed all patients included up to March 31, 2022 without missing data regarding bleeding and thrombotic events. The association of bleeding and thrombotic events with in-hospital mortality and pre-ECMO variables was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 620 patients supported by ECMO, 29% had only bleeding events, 16% only thrombotic events and 20% both bleeding and thrombosis. Cannulation site (18% of patients), ear nose and throat (12%), pulmonary bleeding (9%) and intracranial hemorrhage (8%) were the most frequent bleeding types. Device-related thrombosis and pulmonary embolism/thrombosis accounted for most of thrombotic events. In-hospital mortality was 55.7%. Bleeding events were associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) = 2.91[1.94-4.4]) but not thrombotic events (adjOR = 1.02[0.68-1.53]). Intracranial hemorrhage was strongly associated with in-hospital mortality (adjOR = 13.5[4.4-41.5]). Ventilation duration before ECMO >/= 7 days and length of ECMO support were associated with bleeding. Thrombosis-associated factors were fibrinogen >/= 6 g/L and length of ECMO support. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide cohort of COVID-19 patients supported by ECMO, bleeding incidence was high and associated with mortality. Intracranial hemorrhage incidence was higher than reported for non-COVID patients and carried the highest risk of death. Thrombotic events were less frequent and not associated with mortality. Length of ECMO support was associated with a higher risk of both bleeding and thrombosis, supporting the development of strategies to minimize ECMO duration.", "CI": ["(c) 2022.

The Omicron variant, in particular, is rapidly gained dominance through its ability to spread. In this study, we elucidated the spatial distribution pattern of Omicron from a global perspective. We used the cumulative number of notified COVID-19 cases per country spanning four weeks up to February 10, 2022, and the proportion of the Omicron variant genomic sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). The global spatial distribution of Omicron was investigated by analyzing Global & Local Moran's I and Getis- Ord General G. The spatial weight matrix was defined by combining K-Nearest neighbour and flight connectivity between countries. The results showed that the epidemic is relatively severe in Europe, countries with a high number of Omicron cases and incidence tended to be clustered spatially. In contrast, there are relatively fewer Omicron cases in Asia and Africa, with few hotspots identified.

However, few case reports have described seborrheic dermatitis (SeBD) and psoriasis (PsO) flares due to masks. Hence, we conducted a multicenter study to clarify the possibility of increased SeBD and PsO flares in association with mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This multicenter study enrolled patients with a diagnosis of facial SeBD and PsO. All dermatological consultations were conducted in teledermatology at baseline (T0) and after 1 month (T1) of >6 hours/day wearing mask. PsO patients were assessed using psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and self-administered PASI (SAPASI), whilst SeBD patients with symptom scale of seborrheic dermatitis' (SSSD) and seborrheic dermatitis area and severity index (SEDASI). RESULTS: A total of 33 (20 males, 13 females, average age 43.61 +/- 9.86) patients with PsO and 33 (20 males, 13 females, average age 44.00 +/- 8.58) with SeBD were enrolled. After 1 month, PsO patients displayed higher values of both PASI and SAPASI (P<0.0001), while SeBD patients experienced a flare, as testified by the increment of both SSSD and SEDASI (P<0.0001).

Many anchors have encouraged coronavirus vaccination for employees and their families. Our objective was to determine whether the presence of an anchor was associated with a higher county-level vaccination rate. METHODS: A cross-sectional study focused on 745 small- and mid-sized US counties. We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Reference USA's US Business Database, Economic Innovation Group's Distressed Communities Index database, 2021 County Health Ratings and Rankings, 2020 US Presidential Election popular vote data, and National Center for Health Statistics urban-rural classification data. We constructed 3 explanatory variables of interest: a binary variable indicating whether the county had an anchor; a continuous variable representing the number of anchors within a county; and the percent of all workers in the county who were employed by an anchor. Multivariable linear regression models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, political party allegiance, rurality, economic distress, and prevalence of smoking and adult obesity. FINDINGS: Counties with an anchor had vaccination rates 2.31 (P<.01) percentage points higher than those without an anchor. The number of anchors in a county was also significantly associated with higher vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts by anchors to encourage vaccination may have been successful, and that anchors may be well positioned to amplify public health messages. However, the influence and efforts of anchors to increase vaccination did not fully mitigate disparities in vaccination rates by race, ethnicity, and political party allegiance.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Authors.

We developed a hemostatic nanoparticle technology that was screened to avoid one component of the infusion response: complement activation. We administered these hemostatic nanoparticles, control nanoparticles, or saline volume controls in a porcine polytrauma model. While the hemostatic nanoparticles promoted clotting as marked by a decrease in prothrombin time and both the hemostatic nanoparticles and controls did not active complement, in a subset of the animals, hard thrombi were found in uninjured tissues in both the hemostatic and control nanoparticle groups. Using data science methods that allow one to work across heterogeneous data sets, we found that the presence of these thrombi correlated with changes in IL-6, INF-alpha, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. While these findings might suggest that this formulation would not be a safe one for translation for trauma, they provide guidance for developing screening tools to make nanoparticle formulations in the complex milieux of trauma as well as for therapeutic interventions more broadly.

Although early studies reported large weight increases, several of these analyses were based on convenience samples or self-reported information. The objective of the current study is to examine the pandemic-related weight increase associated with the pandemic through May 2021. METHODS: We selected 4.25 million adults (18 to 84 y) in an electronic health record database who had at least two weight measurements between January 2019 and February 2020 and one after June 2020. We contrasted weight changes before and after March 2020 using mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: Compared with pre-pandemic weight trend, there was a small increase (0.1 kg) in weight in the first year of the pandemic (March 2020 through March 2021). Weight changes during the pandemic varied by sex, age, and initial BMI, but the largest mean increase across these characteristics was < 1.3 kg. Weight increases were generally greatest among women, adults with a BMI of 30 or 35 kg/m(2) , and younger adults. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the mean weight gain among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic may be small. This article is protected by copyright.

Data are also limited regarding the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) on COVID-19-related risk perceptions over time. To address these knowledge gaps, we extracted tweets regarding COVID-19-related risk perceptions and developed indicators for the three dimensions of risk perceptions based on over 502 million geotagged tweets posted by over 4.9 million Twitter users from January 2020 to December 2021 in the United States. We examined correlations between risk perception indicator scores and county-level SDOH. The three dimensions of risk perceptions demonstrate different trajectories. Perceived severity maintained a high level throughout the study period. Perceived susceptibility and negative emotion peaked on March 11, 2020 (COVID-19 declared global pandemic by WHO) and then declined and remained stable at lower levels until increasing once again with the Omicron period. Relative frequency of tweet posts on risk perceptions did not closely follow epidemic trends of COVID-19 (cases, deaths).

Furthermore, economic strength has failed to explain the significant performance difference across countries in combatting COVID-19. Unlike common diseases, epidemic diseases add substantial unpredictability, complexity, and uncertainty to decision-making. Knowledge miscalibration on epidemiological uncertainties by policymaker's over- and underconfidence can seriously impact policymaking. Ineffective risk communication may lead to conflicting and incoherent information transmission. As a result, public reactions and attitudes could be influenced by policymakers' confidence due to the level of public trust, which eventually affects the degree to which an epidemic spreads. To uncover the impacts of policymakers' confidence and public trust on the medical capacity investment, we establish epidemic diffusion models to characterize how transmission evolves with (and without) vaccination and frame the capacity investment problem as a newsvendor problem. Our results show that if the public fully trusts the public health experts, the policymaker's behavioral bias is always harmful, but its effect on cost increment is marginal. If a policymaker's behavior induces public reactions due to public trust, both the spread of the epidemic and the overall performance will be significantly affected, but such impacts are not always harmful. Decision bias may be beneficial when policymakers are pessimistic or highly overconfident.

Although the main clinical manifestation is pulmonary disease, neurological manifestations are a prominent and increasingly recognized feature of the disease. The Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare autoimmune disorder, most commonly triggered by a viral infection. There are a few case reports of ADEM associated with COVID-19, almost all of them associated pulmonary disease. We report the case of a young patient with diagnosis of ADEM with SARS-CoV-2 infection without clinical respiratory symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old woman with no relevant medical history was brought to the emergency department with a progressive confusional state lasted for 7 days. Family reported the development of smell and taste deficit since two weeks before the onset of neurological symptoms. There were no complaints of pulmonary symptoms. At admission, she was drowsy and disoriented. Left homonymous hemianopsia and an ipsilateral Babinski sign was identified. A brain magnetic resonance image was done showing multiple hyperintense bilateral, asymmetric patchy and poorly marginated lesions with gadolinium enhancement. She was SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive on nasopharyngeal swab. Intravenous high-dose glucocorticoids were administered with marked clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: ADEM is an extremely uncommon complication of SARS-CoV-2infection. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis should be considered a potentially treatable cause of encephalopathy or multifocal neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms.", "FAU": ["Lozano-Iraguen, P", "Arribas-Del Campo, J", "Castro-Pesce, A", "Morales-Garcia, C", "Chiang-Odeh, F", "Pelayo-Varela, C"], "AU": ["Lozano-Iraguen P", "Arribas-Del Campo J",

Although wildlife pathogens are well-studied clinically and ecologically, there is very little systematic scholarship on their management or on policy implications. The current global pandemic therefore presents a unique social science research imperative: to understand how decisions are made about preventing and responding to wildlife diseases, especially zoonoses, and how those policy processes can be improved as part of early warning systems, preparedness and rapid response. To meet these challenges, we recommend intensified research efforts towards: (i) generating functional insights about wildlife and zoonotic disease policy processes, (ii) enabling social and organizational learning to mobilize those insights, (iii) understanding epistemic instability to address populist anti-science and (iv) anticipating evolving and new zoonotic emergences, especially their human dimensions. Since policy processes for zoonoses can be acutely challenged during the early stages of an epidemic or pandemic, such insights can provide a pragmatic, empirically-based roadmap for enhancing their

targeting non-antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) that also reduces overall antibiotic prescribing and maintains patient satisfaction. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Patients and clinicians at the urgent care clinics of an integrated academic health system. INTERVENTION AND METHODS: The stewardship activities started in fiscal 2020 and included measure development, comparative feedback, and clinician and patient education. We measured antibiotic prescribing in fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021 for the stewardship targets, potential diagnosis-shifting visits, and overall. We also collected patient satisfaction data for ARI visits. RESULTS: From FY19 to FY21, 576,609 patients made 1,358,816 visits to 17 urgent care clinics, including 105,781 visits for which stewardship measures were applied and 149,691 visits for which diagnosis shifting measures were applied. The antibiotic prescribing rate decreased for stewardship-measure visits from 34% in FY19 to 12% in FY21 (absolute change, -22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -23% to -22%). The antibiotic prescribing rate decreased for diagnosis-shifting visits from 63% to 35% (-28%; 95% CI, -28% to -27%), and the antibiotic prescribing rate decreased overall from 30% to 10% (-20%; 95% CI, -20% to -20%). The patient satisfaction rate increased from 83% in FY19 to 89% in FY20 and FY21. There was no significant association between antibiotic prescribing rates of individual clinicians and ARI visit patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Although it was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, an ambulatory antimicrobial stewardship program that focused on improving non-antibiotic-appropriate ARI prescribing was associated with decreased prescribing for (1) the stewardship target, (2) a diagnosis shifting measure, and (3) overall antibiotic prescribing. Patient satisfaction at ARI visits increased over time and was not associated with clinicians' antibiotic prescribing rates.", "FAU": ["Patel, Dharmesh", "Ng, Teresa", "Madani, Lubna S", "Persell, Stephen D", "Greg, Mark", "Roemer, Phillip E", "Oberoi, Sonali K", "Linder, Jeffrey A"], "AU": ["Patel D", "Ng T", "Madani LS", "Persell SD", "Greg M", "Roemer PE", "Oberoi SK", "Linder JA"], "AD": ["Quality and Patient Safety, Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois.", "Population Health Analytics, Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.", "Division of Immediate Care, Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois.", "Division of General Internal Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.", "Center for Primary Care Innovation, Institute for Public Health and Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.", "Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois.", "Ambulatory Pharmacy, Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.", "Division of General Internal Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.", "Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois.", "Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois.", "Division of General Internal Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.", "Center for Primary Care Innovation, Institute for Public Health and Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.", "Northwestern Medical Group, Chicago, Illinois."], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2217-184X"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220713", "PL": "United States", "TA": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "JT": "Infection control and hospital epidemiology", "JID": "8804099", "SB": "IM", "EDAT": "2022/07/14 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/14 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/13 04:23"], "PHST": ["2022/07/13 04:23 [entrez]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/14 06:00 [medline]"], "AID": ["S0899823X22001647 [pii]", "10.1017/ice.2022.164 [doi]"], "PST": "aheadofprint", "SO": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2022 Jul 13:1-10. doi: 10.1017/ice.2022.164."}, {"PMID": "35822341", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "Publisher", "LR": "20220713", "IS": "1369-1619 (Electronic) 0960-3123 (Linking)", "DP": "2022 Jul 13", "TI": "Association between coping resources and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in the Czech Republic.", "PG": "1-9", "LID": "10.1080/09603123.2022.2098260 [doi]", "AB": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused detrimental global consequences for public health, health-care systems, economies, and society in general.

Growing evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection, by virtue of molecular mimicry can lead to an antigen-mediated cross-reaction promoting the development of a plethora of autoimmune spectrum diseases involving lungs and extrapulmonary tissues alike. In both COVID-19 and autoimmune disease, the immune self-tolerance breaks, leading to an overreaction of the immune system with production of a variety of autoantibodies, sharing similarities in clinical manifestation, laboratory, imaging, and pathology findings. Anti-Melanoma Differentiation-Associated gene 5 dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5 DM) comprises a rare subtype of systemic inflammatory myopathies associated with characteristic cutaneous features and life-threatening rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD). The production of anti-MDA5 autoantibodies was proposed to be triggered by viral infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old male patient with polyarthritis, fatigue and exertional dyspnea was referred to our department. An elevated anti-MDA5 autoantibody titer, myositis on MRI, ground glass opacifications on lung CT and histological features of Wong-type dermatomyositis were confirmed, suggesting the diagnosis of an anti-MDA5 DM. Amid further diagnostic procedures, a serologic proof of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection emerged. Subsequently, the patient deteriorated into a fulminant respiratory failure and an urgent lung transplantation was performed, leading to remission ever since (i.e. 12 months as of now). CONCLUSIONS: We report a unique case of a patient with a new-onset anti-MDA5 DM with fulminant ARDS emerging in a post-infectious stage of COVID-19, who underwent a successful lung transplantation and achieved remission.

We aimed to develop a virtual curriculum with the goals for students to gain knowledge in plastic surgery, to acquire technical skills, and to be able to promote community. METHODS: We developed a four-week educational curriculum of topics in plastic surgery using the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Resident Education Curriculum and an online plastic surgery curriculum. Virtual flipped classroom case discussions and weekly surgical skills workshops were offered. Pre- and post-course surveys were administered, and results analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0. RESULTS: 303 medical students and recent graduates enrolled in the course in June 2020. 182 students completed the pre-course survey (60% response rate), and of those, 50.0% (n=91) completed the post-course survey for paired comparison. Students reported significant improvement in confidence discussing the relevant anatomy, work-up and surgical approaches to clinical cases, as well as confidence in knowledge of all topic areas (p<0.001). Confidence in suturing and knot-tying techniques significantly improved among workshop participants (p<0.001). Students applying to residency programs this cycle felt significantly more prepared for sub-internships (p<0.001) and significantly more connected to the community of applicants (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Virtual Curriculum (PRSVC) improved knowledge, surgical skills, and community in the field among medical student participants.

These hurdles can partly be overcome by adopting modular DNA design principles, automated sequence fragmentation, and plasmid assembly. To this end we have designed a robust, multimodule golden gate based cloning platform for construct generation with a wide range of applications. The assembly efficiency of the system was validated by splitting sfGFP and sfCherry3C cassettes and expressing them in E. coli followed by fluorometric assessment. To minimize timelines and cost for complex constructs, we developed a software tool named FRAGLER (FRAGment recycLER) that performs codon optimization, multiple sequence alignment, and automated generation of fragments for recycling. To highlight the flexibility and robustness of the platform, we (i) generated plasmids for SarsCoV2 protein reagents, (ii) automated and parallelized assemblies, and (iii) built modular libraries of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) variants.

METHODS: Five databases (Medline, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine COVID-19 vaccine tracker) were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials between 1 January 2020 and 12 January 2022 according to predetermined criteria with no language limitations. RESULTS: Forty-two datasets were identified, with 20 vaccines using four different technologies (viral vector, inactivated, mRNA and protein sub-unit). Adults and adolescents over 12 years were included. Control groups used saline placebos, adjuvants, and comparator vaccines. The most consistently reported solicited adverse events were fever, fatigue, headache, pain at injection site, redness, and swelling. Both doses of mRNA vaccines, the second dose of protein subunit and the first dose of adenovirus vectored vaccines were the most reactogenic, while the inactivated vaccines were the least reactogenic.

METHODS: This was a single-center, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of BBIBP-CorV, AZD1222, or BNT162b2 as the third vaccination. The key eligible criteria were individuals at least 18 years old who were fully vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac vaccine for 2-4 months. The primary endpoint was the ratio of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of the total anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody post-vaccination compared with that pre-vaccination. The secondary endpoint was reactogenicity within 7 days. RESULTS: Forty-one participants received AZD1222, 40 received BBIBP-CorV, and 40 received BNT162b2. The GMC of anti-RBD antibody at 2 weeks post-vaccination was 31,138.67 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL for BNT162b2, 6,412.10 BAU/mL for AZD1222, and 1,092.7 BAU/mL for BBIBP-CorV.

The first case presented a finding of tetraparesis prominent in the lower extremities that started ten days after the Covid-19 infection. The second patient was admitted with paraparesis and urinary-stool retention on the 12th day from the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 infection.

In SARS-CoV-2, ORF8 is one of the most important accessory proteins with a role in immune modulation. There are multiple disulfide bonds in the wild type (WT) ORF8. Here, we present an in silico study on the effects of the disulfide bonds in ORF8 on the aspects of the structural properties and binding properties with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A). We first define five possible states for ORF8 with different disulfide bond reduction schemes. For each state, we collect the conformational ensemble using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent. From the analysis of the structural properties, we find that the reduction of the disulfide bonds has small effects on the global properties but much larger effects on the ORF8-specific region that is located on the surface of the ORF8 dimer. Interestingly, we find that the dimer does not break into two monomers at room temperature even if all the disulfide bonds get reduced. Further, we investigate the role of the disulfide bonds in the interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) by performing docking between HLA-A and the conformational ensembles of ORF8 in different states. We give predictions on the preferred binding sites for each state and validate the predictions for the WT dimer with the experimental data on epitopes. In the end, we evaluate the stability of the complexes formed between HLA-A and ORF8 in each state using MD simulations.

We reviewed data to determine whether there was an increase in presentations of SPA during periods of social restrictions. METHODS: The National Integrated Medical Imaging Service was searched for all skeletal survey examinations performed between the dates of the 1 March 2016 and 28 Feb 2021 for studies performed in cases of SPA. Electronic records of attendance were extracted from the emergency department administrative system at the three paediatric emergency departments which serve the 400,000 children regionally.

RESULTS: 311 individual paediatric patients aged 24 months and under were referred for SPA skeletal survey during the study period.

The reasons for the slow adoption of such technology-driven services have been attributed to social norms, health care policies, and a lack of infrastructure to support the delivery of services. However, the COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdown of in-person health care services resulted in the usage of telehealth services as a necessity rather than a choice. The pandemic also fast-tracked some needed legislation to allow medical cost reimbursement for remote examination and health care services. As services return to normalcy, it is important to examine whether the usage of telehealth services during the period of a shutdown has changed any of the trends in the acceptance of telehealth as a reliable alternative to traditional in-person health care services. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore whether the temporary shift to telehealth services has changed the attitudes toward the usage of technology-enabled health services in rural communities. METHODS: We examined the Medicaid reimbursement data for the state of Alabama from March 2019 through June 2021. Selecting the telehealth service codes, we explored the adoption rates in 3 phases of the COVID-19 shutdown: prepandemic, pandemic before the rollout of mass vaccination, and pandemic after the rollout of mass vaccination. RESULTS: The trend in telemedicine claims had an opposite pattern to that in nontelemedicine claims across the 3 periods. The distribution of various characteristics of patients who used telemedicine (age group, gender, race, level of rurality, and service provider type) was different across the 3 periods. Claims related to behavior and mental health had the highest rates of telemedicine usage after the onset of the pandemic. The rate of telemedicine usage remained at a high level after the rollout of mass vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The current trends indicate that adoption of telehealth services is likely to increase postpandemic and that the consumers (patients), service providers, health care establishments, insurance companies, and state and local policies have changed their attitudes toward telehealth. An increase in the use of telehealth could help local and federal governments address the shortage of health care facilities and service providers in underserved communities, and patients can get the much-needed care in a timely and effective manner.", "CI": ["(c)Pei Xu, Matthew Hudnall, Sidi Zhao, Uzma Raja, Jason Parton, Dwight Lewis.", "Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research", "(https://www.jmir.org), 15.07.2022."], "FAU": ["Xu, Pei", "Hudnall, Matthew", "Zhao, Sidi", "Raja, Uzma", "Parton, Jason", "Lewis, Dwight"], "AU": ["Xu P", "Hudnall M", "Zhao S", "Raja U", "Parton J", "Lewis D"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0604-7240", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3063-2458", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7823-2077", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5791-8566", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6636-1090", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8557-3558"], "AD": ["Department of Systems and Technology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States.", "Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States.", "Department of Systems and Technology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States.", "Department of Systems and Technology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, United States.", "Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States.", "Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220715", "PL": "Canada", "TA": "J Med Internet Res", "JT": "Journal of medical Internet research", "JID": "100959882", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control", "Humans", "Medicaid", "Pandemics/prevention & control", "Rural Population", "*Telemedicine", "United States"], "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "Medicaid", "health care facility", "health care service", "health claim", "health insurance", "health service", "mental health", "rural communities", "technology adoption", "telehealth", "telehealth services", "telemedicine", "undeserved community", "undeserved population"], "EDAT": "2022/07/06 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/20 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/05 13:32"], "PHST": ["2022/04/08 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/03 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/05/19 00:00 [revised]", "2022/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/20 06:00 [medline]", "2022/07/05 13:32 [entrez]"], "AID": ["v24i7e38602 [pii]", "10.2196/38602 [doi]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jul 15;24(7):e38602. doi: 10.2196/38602."}, {"PMID": "35780474", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "MEDLINE", "DCOM": "20220719", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "1326-5377 (Electronic) 0025-729X (Linking)", "VI": "217", "IP": "2", "DP": "2022 Jul 18", "TI": "mRNA vaccines: a transformative technology with applications beyond COVID-19.", "PG": "71-75", "LID": "10.5694/mja2.51620 [doi]", "FAU": ["Overmars, Isabella", "Au-Yeung, George", "Nolan, Terence M", "Steer, Andrew C"], "AU": ["Overmars I", "Au-Yeung G", "Nolan TM", "Steer AC"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9710-6113"], "AD": ["Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC.", "Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC.", "University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC.", "University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC.", "Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC.", "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC.", "University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220703", "PL": "Australia", "TA": "Med J Aust", "JT": "The Medical journal of Australia", "JID": "0400714", "RN": ["0 (Vaccines)", "0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)", "0 (mRNA Vaccine)", "0 (mRNA Vaccines)"], "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19/prevention & control", "Humans", "Technology", "Vaccination", "*Vaccines", "Vaccines, Synthetic/genetics", "mRNA Vaccines"], "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Microbiology", "Preventive medicine", "Vaccination", "Vaccine preventable disease", "Vaccines", "Virus diseases"], "EDAT": "2022/07/04 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/20 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/07/03 14:01"], "PHST": ["2022/02/14 00:00 [revised]", "2021/11/10 00:00 [received]", "2022/03/28 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/20 06:00 [medline]", "2022/07/03 14:01 [entrez]"], "AID": ["10.5694/mja2.51620 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "Med J Aust. 2022 Jul 18;217(2):71-75. doi: 10.5694/mja2.51620.

A rigorous strategy for carrying out such calculations is the so-called \"geometrical route\". In this method, two molecular objects are progressively separated from one another in the presence of orientational and conformational restraints serving to control the change in configurational entropy that accompanies the dissociation process, thereby allowing the computations to converge within simulations of affordable length. Although the geometrical route provides a rigorous theoretical framework, a tantalizing computational shortcut consists of simply leaving out such orientational and conformational degrees of freedom during the separation process. Here the accuracy and convergence of the two approaches are critically compared in the case of two protein-ligand complexes (Abl kinase-SH3:p41 and MDM2-p53:NVP-CGM097) and three protein-protein complexes (pig insulin dimer, SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD:ACE2, and CheA kinase-P2:CheY). The results of the simulations that strictly follow the geometrical route match the experimental standard binding free energies within chemical accuracy. In contrast, simulations bereft of geometrical restraints converge more poorly, yielding inconsistent results that are at variance with the experimental measurements. Furthermore, the orientational and positional time correlation functions of the protein in the unrestrained simulations decay over several microseconds, a time scale that is far longer than the typical simulation times of the geometrical route, which explains why those simulations fail to sample the relevant degrees of freedom during the separation process of the complexes.", "FAU": ["Blazhynska, Marharyta", "Goulard Coderc de Lacam, Emma", "Chen, Haochuan", "Roux, Benoit", "Chipot, Christophe"], "AU": ["Blazhynska M", "Goulard Coderc de Lacam E", "Chen H", "Roux B", "Chipot C"], "AD": ["Laboratoire International Associe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7019, Universite de Lorraine, B.P. 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy Cedex, France.", "Laboratoire International Associe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7019, Universite de Lorraine, B.P. 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy Cedex, France.", "Laboratoire International Associe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7019, Universite de Lorraine, B.P. 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy Cedex, France.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, 929 East 57th Street, W225, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.", "Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago, 5735 South Ellis Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.", "Laboratoire International Associe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Unite Mixte de Recherche 7019, Universite de Lorraine, B.P. 70239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy Cedex, France.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, 929 East 57th Street, W225, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.", "Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group, Beckman Institute, and Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0001-6447-1096", "ORCID: 0000-0002-5254-2712", "ORCID: 0000-0002-9122-1698"], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "DEP": "20220630", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Phys Chem Lett", "JT": "The journal of physical chemistry letters", "JID": "101526034", "RN": ["0 (Ligands)", "0 (Proteins)"], "SB": "IM", "MH": ["Animals", "*COVID-19", "Entropy", "Ligands", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Proteins/chemistry", "*SARS-CoV-2", "Swine", "Thermodynamics"], "EDAT": "2022/07/01 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/16 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/06/30 12:53"], "PHST": ["2022/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/16 06:00 [medline]", "2022/06/30 12:53 [entrez]"], "AID": ["10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01490 [doi]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "J Phys Chem Lett. 2022 Jul 14;13(27):6250-6258. doi: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01490.

inflammatory regulators, but their role in the immunopathology of COVID-19 is still unclear. Here, we used human blood and tracheal aspirate (TA) to investigate whether acetylcholine (Ach), fatty acids (FAs), and their derived lipid mediators (LMs) are associated with COVID-19 severity. First, we analyzed the perturbation profile induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the transcriptional profile of genes related to the ACh and FA/LM pathways. Blood and TA were used for metabolomic and lipidomic analyses and for quantification of leukocytes, cytokines, and ACh. Differential expression and coexpression gene network data revealed a unique transcriptional profile associated with ACh and FA/LM production, release, and cellular signaling. Transcriptomic data were corroborated by laboratory findings: SARS-CoV-2 infection increased plasma and TA levels of arachidonic acid, 5-hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid, 11-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid, and ACh. TA samples also exhibited high levels of PGE2, thromboxane B2, 12-oxo-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 6-trans-leukotriene B4 Bioinformatics and experimental approaches demonstrated robust correlation between transcriptional profile in Ach and FA/LM pathways and parameters of severe COVID-19. As expected, the increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil counts, and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, IL-1beta, and IL-8) correlated with worse clinical scores. Glucocorticoids protected severe and critical patients and correlated with reduced Ach levels in plasma and TA samples. We demonstrated that pulmonary and systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 are associated with high levels of Ach and FA/LM. Glucocorticoids favored the survival of patients with severe/critical disease, and this effect was associated with a reduction in ACh levels.", "FAU": ["Perez, Malena M", "Pimentel, Vinicius E", "Fuzo, Carlos A", "da Silva-Neto, Pedro V", "Toro, Diana M", "Fraga-Silva, Thais F C", "Gardinassi, Luiz G", "Oliveira, Camilla N S", "Souza, Camila O S", "Torre-Neto, Nicola T", "de Carvalho, Jonatan C S", "De Leo, Thais C", "Nardini, Viviani", "Feitosa, Marley R", "Parra, Rogerio S", "da Rocha, Jose J R", "Feres, Omar", "Vilar, Fernando C", "Gaspar, Gilberto G", "Constant, Leticia F", "Ostini, Fatima M", "Degiovani, Augusto M", "Amorim, Alessandro P", "Viana, Angelina L", "Fernandes, Ana P M", "Maruyama, Sandra R", "Russo, Elisa M S", "Santos, Isabel K F M", "Bonato, Vania L D", "Cardoso, Cristina R B", "Sorgi, Carlos A", "Dias-Baruffi, Marcelo", "Faccioli, Lucia H"], "AU": ["Perez MM", "Pimentel VE", "Fuzo CA", "da Silva-Neto PV", "Toro DM", "Fraga-Silva TFC", "Gardinassi LG", "Oliveira CNS", "Souza COS", "Torre-Neto NT", "de Carvalho JCS", "De Leo TC", "Nardini V", "Feitosa MR", "Parra RS", "da Rocha JJR", "Feres O", "Vilar FC", "Gaspar GG", "Constant LF", "Ostini FM", "Degiovani AM", "Amorim AP", "Viana AL", "Fernandes APM", "Maruyama SR", "Russo EMS", "Santos IKFM", "Bonato VLD", "Cardoso CRB", "Sorgi CA", "Dias-Baruffi M", "Faccioli LH"], "AD": ["Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Biociencias e Biotecnologia Aplicadas a Farmacia, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Biociencias e Biotecnologia Aplicadas a Farmacia, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.", "Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Instituto de Patologia Tropical e Saude Publica, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, Goias, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Departamento de Analises Clinicas, Toxicologicas e Bromatologicas, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Imunologia Basica e Aplicada, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Sao Paulo, Brazil.", "Departamento de Quimica.

In particular, sex workers are disproportionately at risk due to the nature of their work and the social stigma that comes alongside it. OBJECTIVE: This study examines how public social media can be used as a tool of professional and personal expression by sex workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to explore an underresearched topic by focusing on sex workers' experiences with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the social media platform Twitter. In particular, we aimed to find the main issues that sex workers discuss on social media in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature review followed by a qualitative analysis of 1458 (re)tweets from 22 sex worker Twitter accounts was used for this study. The tweets were qualitatively coded by theme through the use of intercoder reliability. Empirical, experimental, and observational studies were included in this review to provide context and support for our findings. RESULTS: In total, 5 major categories were identified as a result of the content analysis used for this study: concerns (n=542, 37.2%), solicitation (n=336, 23.0%), herd mentality (n=231, 15.8%), humor (n=190, 13.0%), and blame (n=146, 10.0%). The concerns category was the most prominent category, which could be due to its multifaceted nature of including individual concerns, health issues, concerns for essential workers and businesses, as well as concerns about inequalities or intersectionality. When using gender as a control factor, the majority of the results were not noteworthy, save for the blame category, in which sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) were more likely to post content. CONCLUSIONS: Though there has been an increase in the literature related to the experiences of sex workers, this paper recommends that future studies could benefit from further examining these 5 major categories through mixed methods research. Examining this phenomenon could recognize the challenges unique to this working community during the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially reduce the widespread stigma associated with sex work in general.", "CI": ["(c)Ahmed Al-Rawi, Kiana Zemenchik.

Evidence has demonstrated increased generalized anxiety and depression among young adults due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, minimal research has examined the longitudinal effect of COVID-19 over the course of time and its impact on anxiety and depression. Additionally, age and gender have been found to play a significant role on individuals' mental health, with young adults and women particularly at risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression upon admissions to treatment. METHODS: This was an observational study that was completed longitudinally in which the grouping variable split the time interval into five equal groups for assessments over each period of time. A total of 112 young adults (aged 18-25 years) were recruited for the study. Participants completed assessments online through a Qualtrics link. RESULTS: Psychometric properties of the admission assessments were uniformly highly statistically significant. There was a significant difference in generalized anxiety between the group-1 and group-3 time intervals. No significant difference was found across the time intervals for depression. Differences in predicting the impact of the psychometrics scores were found with respect to gender. Only the ability to participate and the quality-of-life subfactor of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) assessment were significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study sought to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on young adults seeking mental health services during the pandemic. Gender emerged as a clear significant factor contributing to increased anxiety in young adults seeking mental health services during the pandemic. These findings have critical importance to ensuring the potential treatment success rate of clients, while providing an overarching understanding of the impact of the pandemic and establishing clinical recommendations for the treatment of individuals who are seeking out treatment.", "CI": ["(c)Amanda Fialk, Alexa Connors, Brianna Cerrito, Karee Jones, Frank Buono.", "Originally published in JMIR Formative Research (https://formative.jmir.org),", "14.07.2022."], "FAU": ["Fialk, Amanda", "Connors, Alexa", "Cerrito, Brianna", "Jones, Karee", "Buono, Frank"], "AU": ["Fialk A", "Connors A", "Cerrito B", "Jones K", "Buono F"], "AUID": ["ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8270-5095", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7644-6418", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9684-0650", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8204-9622", "ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1324-7857"], "AD": ["The Dorm, New York City, NY, United States.", "The Dorm, New York City, NY, United States.", "The Dorm, New York City, NY, United States.", "The Dorm, New York City, NY, United States.", "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220714", "PL": "Canada", "TA": "JMIR Form Res", "JT": "JMIR formative research", "JID": "101726394", "PMC": "PMC9285669", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["COVID-19", "Qualtrics", "anxiety", "depression", "gender", "mental health", "mental health service", "mental health treatment", "psychometric properties", "quality of life", "young adults", "youth"], "EDAT": "2022/06/30 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/06/30 06:01", "CRDT": ["2022/06/29 14:52"], "PHST": ["2022/05/02 00:00 [received]", "2022/06/27 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/06/21 00:00 [revised]", "2022/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/06/30 06:01 [medline]", "2022/06/29 14:52 [entrez]"], "AID": ["v6i7e39217 [pii]", "10.2196/39217 [doi]"], "PST": "epublish", "SO": "JMIR Form Res. 2022 Jul 14;6(7):e39217. doi: 10.2196/39217."}, {"PMID": "35767687", "OWN": "NLM", "STAT": "In-Process", "LR": "20220719", "IS": "1520-5851 (Electronic) 0013-936X (Linking)", "VI": "56", "IP": "14", "DP": "2022 Jul 19", "TI": "Ground-Level NO2 Surveillance from Space Across China for High Resolution Using Interpretable Spatiotemporally Weighted Artificial Intelligence.", "PG": "9988-9998", "LID": "10.1021/acs.est.2c03834 [doi]", "AB": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at the ground level poses a serious threat to environmental quality and public health.

The daily seamless high-resolution and high-quality dataset \"ChinaHighNO2\" allows us to examine spatial patterns at fine scales such as the urban-rural contrast. We observed systematic large differences between urban and rural areas (28% on average) in surface NO2, especially in provincial capitals. Strong holiday effects were found, with average declines of 22 and 14% during the Spring Festival and the National Day in China, respectively. Unlike North America and Europe, there is little difference between weekdays and weekends (within +/-1 mug/m(3)).

At that time, social media had been used to augment in-person conference learning, but it had not been used as the sole platform for scholarly abstract presentations. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the feasibility of using Twitter to provide a completely web-based forum for real-time dissemination of and engagement with student scholarly work as an alternative to a traditional in-person poster presentation session. METHODS: The Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University launched an online Medical Student Scholarship Forum, using Twitter as a platform for students to present scholarly work and prepare for future web-based presentations. A single student forum participant created posts using a standardized template that incorporated student research descriptions, uniform promotional hashtags, and individual poster presentations. Tweets were released over 5 days and analytic data were collected from the Twitter platform. Outcome measures included impressions, engagements, retweets, likes, media engagements, and average daily engagement rate. RESULTS: During the conference, the student leader published 63 tweets promoting the work of 58 students (55 medical and 3 dental students) over 5 days. During the forum and the following week, tweets from the @BrodyDistinctly Twitter account received 63,142 impressions and 7487 engagements, including 187 retweets, 1427 likes, and 2082 media engagements. During the 5 days of the forum, the average daily engagement rate was 12.72%. CONCLUSIONS: Using Twitter as a means of scholarly dissemination resulted in a larger viewing community compared to a traditional in-person event. Early evidence suggests that social media platforms may be an alternative to traditional scholarly presentations. Presenting via Twitter allowed students to receive instantaneous feedback and effectively network with wider academic communities. Additional research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge uptake, feedback, and networking.", "CI": ["(c)Gary Allen, Jenna Garris, Luan Lawson, Timothy Reeder, Jennifer Crotty,", "Johanna Hannan, Kori Brewer.

To overcome this, we used a novel citizen science campaign to detect emission changes during lockdown and engage youth in climate science. Citizen scientists collected grass samples from their garden or local park, from which we analyzed the radiocarbon content to infer the recently added atmospheric fossil fuel CO2 mole fraction at each sampling location. The local fossil fuel CO2 mole fractions during lockdown were compared with a \"normal\" nonlockdown period. Our results from 17 sites in five cities around New Zealand demonstrate dramatic reductions in traffic emissions of 75 +/- 3% during the most severe lockdown restriction period. This is consistent with sparse local traffic count information and a much larger decrease in traffic emissions than reported in global aggregate estimates of emission changes.

Improved characterization of ACE2 regulation may help us understand the effects of pre-existing conditions on COVID-19 incidence, as well as pathogenic dysregulation following viral infection. Here, we perform bioinformatic analyses to hypothesize on ACE2 gene regulation in two different physiological contexts, identifying putative regulatory elements of ACE2 expression. We perform functional validation of our computational predictions via targeted CRISPR-Cas9 deletions of these elements in vitro, finding them responsive to immune signaling and oxidative-stress pathways. This contributes to our understanding of ACE2 gene regulation at baseline and immune challenge.

Here, using human fetal pancreas samples and 3D differentiation of human pluripotent cells into pancreatic endocrine cells, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1 are expressed in precursors of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells, rendering them permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 enters and undergoes efficient replication in human multipotent pancreatic and endocrine progenitors in vitro. Moreover, we investigated mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 enters pancreatic cells, and found that ACE2 mediates the entry, while NRP1 and TMPRSS2 do not. Surprisingly, we found that in pancreatic progenitors, SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via cathepsin-dependent endocytosis, which is a different route than in respiratory tract.

Although eHealth literacy is acknowledged as a critical component of public health, it was overlooked during the pandemic. To assist patients and their families, health professionals should be knowledgeable about online health information resources and capable of evaluating relevant online information. In a resource-constrained situation, the level of eHealth literacy among health professionals is not well documented. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the eHealth literacy level and its associated factors among health professionals working in Amhara regional state teaching hospitals, Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was used in an institutional-based cross-sectional study design. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe eHealth literacy statements and key variables using SPSS v.24. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fit to identify factors related to eHealth literacy. Variables with P<.05 were declared to be statistically significant predictors. RESULTS: A total of 383 participants completed and returned the questionnaire with a response rate of 90.5%. Health professionals demonstrated a moderate level of eHealth literacy (mean 29.21). Most of the professionals were aware of the available health resources located on the internet, and know how to search and locate these resources. However, they lack the ability to distinguish high-quality health resources from low-quality resources. Factors that were significantly associated with eHealth literacy were computer access, computer knowledge, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness of eHealth information resources. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to provide training and support to health care workers on how to find, interpret, and, most importantly, evaluate the quality of health information found on the internet to improve their eHealth literacy level. Further research is needed to explore the role of eHealth literacy in mitigating pandemics in developing countries.", "CI": ["(c)Getanew Aschalew Tesfa, Delelegn Emwodew Yehualashet, Helen Ali Ewune, Addisu", "Getnet Zemeskel, Mulugeta Hayelom Kalayou, Binyam Tariku Seboka.

The need for ultrasensitive easy-to-use platforms has culminated in an increased interest for rapid response equipment-free alternatives to conventional diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction, western-blot assay, etc. Furthermore, the poor stability and the bleaching behavior of several contemporary fluorescent reporters is a major obstacle in understanding the mechanism of viral infection thus retarding drug screening and development. Owing to their extraordinary surface-to-volume ratio as well as their quantum confinement and charge transfer properties, nanomaterials are desirable additives to sensing and imaging systems to amplify their signal response as well as temporal resolution. Their large surface area promotes biomolecular integration as well as efficacious signal transduction. Due to their hole mobility, photostability, resistance to photobleaching, and intense brightness, nanomaterials have a considerable edge over organic dyes for single virus tracking. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of combining carbon-allotrope, inorganic and organic-based nanomaterials with virus sensing and tracking methods, starting with the impact of human pathogenic viruses on the society. We address how different nanomaterials can be used in various virus sensing platforms (e.g. lab-on-a-chip, paper, and smartphone-based point-of-care systems) as well as in virus tracking applications.

Here, a drug repurposing strategy using nanotechnology is explored to develop a therapy for COVID-19 treatment. Nanoparticles (NPs) based on PLGA for fingolimod (FTY720) encapsulation show a size of approximately 150 nm and high drug entrapment ( approximately 90%). The NP (NP@FTY720) can control FTY720 release in a pH-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays using different cell lines show that NP@FTY720 displays less toxicity than the free drug. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy reveal that NPs are actively internalized mostly through caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis pathways and co-localized with lysosomes. Finally, NP@FTY720 not only exhibits anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, but its biological potential for viral infection inhibition is nearly 70 times higher than that of free drug treatment.

Changes in lifestyles due to the pandemic may cause psychosocial stressors for individuals and could lead to mental health problems. To provide high-quality mental health support, health care organizations need to identify COVID-19-specific stressors and monitor the trends in the prevalence of those stressors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media data to identify the psychosocial stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the trend in the prevalence of these stressors at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We obtained a data set of 9266 Reddit posts from the subreddit \\rCOVID19_support, from February 14, 2020, to July 19, 2021. We used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the topics that were mentioned on the subreddit and analyzed the trends in the prevalence of the topics. Lexicons were created for each of the topics and were used to identify the topics of each post. The prevalences of topics identified by the LDA and lexicon approaches were compared. RESULTS: The LDA model identified 6 topics from the data set: (1) \"fear of coronavirus,\" (2) \"problems related to social relationships,\" (3) \"mental health symptoms,\" (4) \"family problems,\" (5) \"educational and occupational problems,\" and (6) \"uncertainty on the development of pandemic.\" According to the results, there was a significant decline in the number of posts about the \"fear of coronavirus\" after vaccine distribution started. This suggests that the distribution of vaccines may have reduced the perceived risks of coronavirus. The prevalence of discussions on the uncertainty about the pandemic did not decline with the increase in the vaccinated population. In April 2021, when the Delta variant became prevalent in the United States, there was a significant increase in the number of posts about the uncertainty of pandemic development but no obvious effects on the topic of fear of the coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: We created a dashboard to visualize the trend in the prevalence of topics about COVID-19-related stressors being discussed on a social media platform (Reddit). Our results provide insights into the prevalence of pandemic-related stressors during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The NLP techniques leveraged in this study could also be applied to analyze event-specific stressors in the future.", "CI": ["(c)Yue Tong Leung, Farzad Khalvati.

Many VoC contain mutations in the spike protein (S-protein) and are implicated in infection and response to therapeutics. Bivalent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are promising therapeutics for COVID-19, but they are limited by low potency and vulnerability to RBD mutations in VoC. To address these issues, we used naive phage-displayed peptide libraries to isolate and optimize 16-residue peptides that bind to the RBD or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-protein. We fused these peptides to the N-terminus of a moderate-affinity nAb to generate tetravalent peptide-IgG fusions, and we showed that both classes of peptides were able to improve affinities for the S-protein trimer by >100-fold (apparent KD < 1 pM). Critically, cell-based infection assays with a panel of six SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrated that an RBD-binding peptide was able to enhance the neutralization potency of a high-affinity nAb >100-fold. Moreover, this peptide-IgG was able to neutralize variants that were resistant to the same nAb in the bivalent IgG format, including the dominant B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant that is resistant to most clinically approved therapeutic nAbs. To show that this approach is general, we fused the same peptide to a clinically approved nAb drug and showed that it enabled the neutralization of a resistant variant. Taken together, these results establish minimal peptide fusions as a modular means to greatly enhance affinities, potencies, and breadth of coverage of nAbs as therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.", "FAU": ["Labriola, Jonathan M", "Miersch, Shane", "Chen, Gang", "Chen, Chao", "Pavlenco, Alevtina", "Saberianfar, Reza", "Caccuri, Francesca", "Zani, Alberto", "Sharma, Nitin", "Feng, Annie", "Leung, Daisy W", "Caruso, Arnaldo", "Novelli, Giuseppe", "Amarasinghe, Gaya K", "Sidhu, Sachdev S"], "AU": ["Labriola JM", "Miersch S", "Chen G", "Chen C", "Pavlenco A", "Saberianfar R", "Caccuri F", "Zani A", "Sharma N", "Feng A", "Leung DW", "Caruso A", "Novelli G", "Amarasinghe GK", "Sidhu SS"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0002-8486-6738", "ORCID: 0000-0001-7755-5918"], "AD": ["Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Department of Molecular Genetics, The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, 160 College St., M5S 3E1 Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "Section of Microbiology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia Medical School, 25123 Brescia, Italy.", "Section of Microbiology, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia Medical School, 25123 Brescia, Italy.", "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri 63110, United States.", "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri 63110, United States.", "Division of Infectious Diseases, John T.

Transplacental transfer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after maternal Covid-19 vaccination may confer protection against Covid-19 in infants. METHODS: We used a case-control test-negative design to assess the effectiveness of maternal vaccination during pregnancy against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants younger than 6 months of age. Between July 1, 2021, and March 8, 2022, we enrolled infants hospitalized for Covid-19 (case infants) and infants hospitalized without Covid-19 (control infants) at 30 hospitals in 22 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of full maternal vaccination (two doses of mRNA vaccine) among case infants and control infants during circulation of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant (July 1, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and the B.1.1.259 (omicron) variant (December 19, 2021, to March 8, 2022). RESULTS: A total of 537 case infants (181 of whom had been admitted to a hospital during the delta period and 356 during the omicron period; median age, 2 months) and 512 control infants were enrolled and included in the analyses; 16% of the case infants and 29% of the control infants had been born to mothers who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy. Among the case infants, 113 (21%) received intensive care (64 [12%] received mechanical ventilation or vasoactive infusions). Two case infants died from Covid-19; neither infant's mother had been vaccinated during pregnancy. The effectiveness of maternal vaccination against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33 to 65) overall, 80% (95% CI, 60 to 90) during the delta period, and 38% (95% CI, 8 to 58) during the omicron period. Effectiveness was 69% (95% CI, 50 to 80) when maternal vaccination occurred after 20 weeks of pregnancy and 38% (95% CI, 3 to 60) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal vaccination with two doses of mRNA vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization for Covid-19, including for critical illness, among infants younger than 6 months of age.

There are many challenges to implementing mass vaccination campaigns for large, diverse populations from crafting vaccine promotion messages to reaching individuals in a timely and effective manner. During this unprecedented period, with COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns essential for protecting vulnerable patient populations and attaining herd immunity, health care systems were faced with the dual challenges of vaccine outreach and distribution. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine text outreach approach for patients aged 65 years and older. Our goal was to determine whether this approach was successful in scheduling patients for COVID-19 vaccine appointments. METHODS: We developed SMS text messages using the Tavoca platform. These messages informed patients of their vaccine eligibility and allowed them to indicate their interest in scheduling an appointment via a specific method (email or phone) or indicate their lack of interest in the vaccine. We tracked the status of these messages and how patients responded. Messages were sent to patients aged 65 years and older (N=30,826) at a nonprofit health care system in Washington, DC. Data were collected and examined from January 14 to May 10, 2021. Data were analyzed using multivariate multinomial and binary logistic regression models in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). RESULTS: Approximately 57% of text messages were delivered to patients, but many messages received no response from patients (40%). Additionally, 42.1% (12,978/30,826) of messages were not delivered. Of the patients who expressed interest in the vaccine (2938/30,826, 9.5%), Black or African American patients preferred a phone call rather than an email for scheduling their appointment (odds ratio [OR] 1.69, 95% CI 1.29-2.21) compared to White patients. Patients aged 70-74 years were more likely to schedule an appointment (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.89) than those aged 65-69 years, and Black or African American patients were more likely to schedule an appointment (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.72-4.91) than White patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into some advantages and challenges of using a text messaging vaccine outreach for patients aged 65 years and older. Lessons learned from this vaccine campaign underscore the importance of using multiple outreach methods and sharing of patient vaccination status between health systems, along with a patient-centered approach to address vaccine hesitancy and access issues.", "CI": ["(c)Naheed Ahmed, Christian Boxley, Ram Dixit, Seth Krevat, Allan Fong, Raj M", "Ratwani, Deliya B Wesley.

In this study, an agent-based network model with small-world topology is employed to find optimal policies against pandemics, including social distancing and vaccination strategies. The agents' states are characterized by a variation of the SEIR model (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). To explore optimal policies, an equation-free method is proposed to solve the inverse problem of calibrating an agent's infection rate with respect to the vaccination efficacy. The results show that prioritizing the first vaccine dose in combination with mild social restrictions, is sufficient to control the pandemic, with respect to the number of deaths.

This study was aimed to explore the experiences of an interdisciplinary palliative care team in meeting the holistic needs of oncology inpatients via telehealth over a 10-week period during the first COVID-19 surge. A targeted sample of interdisciplinary palliative specialists at an urban comprehensive cancer center participated in in-depth interviews that explored participants' experiences delivering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual care via telehealth. An interdisciplinary coding team followed a rigorous thematic text analysis approach and met regularly to reach consensus on emerging themes. Eleven palliative specialists from six disciplines (chaplaincy, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physician assistant, and social work) participated. Seventy-three percent reported not receiving telehealth training prior to COVID-19 and 64% were \"not at all\" or \"somewhat comfortable\" delivering telepalliative care. Several themes were identified, including the barriers related to telehealth, the impact of telehealth on the quality of relationships with patients, their families, and coworkers, and the changes in perceived self-efficacy of fulfilling job responsibilities. Telehealth use has increased significantly during COVID-19, requiring further evaluation of its utility. Participants reported both positive and negative inpatient telepalliative care experiences associated with various domains of professional functioning, such as communication, relationships with key stakeholders, and self-efficacy.

Because of cross-reactive CSPs in the entry mediators, the anti-CSP sdAb neutralized in vitro and in vivo the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 unrelated viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and pestes des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Conversely, anti-HSV1 and anti-PPRV sera neutralized LV(CoV2 S) owing to the presence of CSP reactive antibodies indicating that a prior infection with such pathogens could impact on the pattern of COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 The Author(s)."], "FAU": ["Singh, Sudhakar", "Dahiya, Surbhi", "Singh, Yuviana J", "Beeton, Komal", "Jain, Ayush", "Sarkar, Roman", "Dubey, Abhishek", "Tehseen, Azeez", "Sehrawat, Sharvan"], "AU": ["Singh S", "Dahiya S", "Singh YJ", "Beeton K", "Jain A", "Sarkar R", "Dubey A", "Tehseen A", "Sehrawat S"], "AD": ["Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India.", "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali, Sector 81, SAS Nagar Knowledge City PO Manauli, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220609", "PL": "United States", "TA": "iScience", "JT": "iScience", "JID": "101724038", "PMC": "PMC9181070", "OTO": ["NOTNLM"], "OT": ["Immunology, and Drugs", "Virology"], "COIS": ["The authors declare no competing interest."], "EDAT": "2022/06/16 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/06/16 06:01", "CRDT": ["2022/06/15 02:14"], "PHST": ["2022/02/22 00:00 [received]", "2022/05/08 00:00 [revised]", "2022/06/02 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/06/16 06:01 [medline]", "2022/06/15 02:14 [entrez]"], "AID": ["10.1016/j.isci.2022.104549 [doi]", "S2589-0042(22)00821-5 [pii]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "iScience. 2022 Jul 15;25(7):104549. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104549.

METHODS: We analyzed data collected by Optum(R), a nationally representative database of electronic medical records, for 369 adults with CHDs and 41,578 without CHDs hospitalized for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. We used Poisson regression to describe and compare epidemiologic characteristics, heart-related conditions, and severe outcomes between these two groups. RESULTS: The distributions of many epidemiologic characteristics were similar between the two groups, but patients with CHDs were significantly more likely to be current or former smokers compared to patients without CHDs (risk ratio [RR]: 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 1.8). Patients with CHDs were also significantly more likely to have heart failure, stroke, acute arrhythmia, myocardial injury, acute pulmonary hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and obesity documented at the time of the COVID-19 hospitalization (RR range: 1.5-4.7) but not respiratory failure. Patients with CHDs (7 days) had a significantly longer median length of stay than those without CHDs (5 days; p < .001) and were significantly more likely to have an intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR: 1.6, 95 CI: 1.2-1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our description of patients among a large population improves our understanding of the clinical course of COVID-19 among adults with CHDs.

In silico analysis of the designed assays for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants using more than four million SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences yielded approximately 100% specificity and >90% sensitivity. All assays could sensitively discriminate and quantify target variants at levels as low as 10 viral RNA copy/microL with minimal cross-reactivity to the corresponding nontarget genotypes, even for sewage samples containing mixtures of SARS-CoV-2 variants with differential abundances. Integration of this method into the routine sewage surveillance in Hong Kong successfully identified the Beta variant in a community sewage. Complete concordance was observed between the results of viral whole-genome sequencing and those of our novel assays in sewage samples that contained exclusively the Delta variant discharged by a clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patient living in a quarantine hotel. Our assays in this method also provided real-time discrimination of the newly emerging Omicron variant in sewage two days prior to clinical test results in another quarantine hotel in Hong Kong.

In particular, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has been used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, while monitoring viral genome mutations requires separate approaches such as deep sequencing. A high throughput sequencing platform (ATOPlex) that uses a multiplex tiled PCR-based enrichment technique has shown promise in detecting variants of concern (VOC) while also providing virus quantitation data. However, detection sensitivities of both RT-qPCR and sequencing can be impacted through losses occurring during sample handling, virus concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and RT-qPCR. Therefore, process limit of detection (PLOD) assessments are required to estimate the gene copies of target molecule to attain specific probability of detection. In this study, we compare the PLOD of four RT-qPCR assays (US CDC N1 and N2, China CDC N and ORF1ab) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 to that of ATOPlex sequencing by seeding known concentrations of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 into wastewater. Results suggest that among the RT-qPCR assays, US CDC N1 was the most sensitive, especially at lower SARS-CoV-2 seed levels. However, when results from all RT-qPCR assays were combined, it resulted in greater detection rates than individual assays, suggesting that application of multiple assays is better suited for the trace detection of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples. Furthermore, while ATOPlex offers a promising approach to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance, this approach appears to be less sensitive compared to RT-qPCR under the experimental conditions of this study, and may require further refinements.

WBE was performed to monitor the occurrence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and six neighborhoods in the city of Calgary, Canada (population 1.44 million). A total of 222 WWTP and 192 neighborhood samples were collected from June 2020 to May 2021, encompassing the end of the first-wave (June 2020), the second-wave (November end to December 2020) and the third-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (mid-April to May 2021). Flow-weighted 24-hour composite samples were processed to extract RNA that was then analyzed for two SARS-CoV-2-specific regions of the nucleocapsid gene, N1 and N2, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Using this approach SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 98.06% (406/414) of wastewater samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance was compared to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases organized by the three-digit postal code of affected individuals' primary residences, enabling correlation analysis at neighborhood, WWTP and city-wide scales. Strong correlations were observed between N1 & N2 gene signals in wastewater and new daily cases for WWTPs and neighborhoods. Similarly, when flow rates at Calgary's three WWTPs were used to normalize observed concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and combine them into a city-wide signal, this was strongly correlated with regionally diagnosed COVID-19 cases and clinical test percent positivity rate. Linked census data demonstrated disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from areas of the city with lower socioeconomic status and more racialized communities. WBE across a range of urban scales was demonstrated to be an effective mechanism of COVID-19 surveillance.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by domestic insects and their potential as a xenosurveillance tool for detection of the virus. Flies were trapped in homes where at least one confirmed human COVID-19 case(s) resided using sticky and liquid-baited fly traps placed inside and outside the home in the Texas counties of Brazos, Bell, and Montgomery, from June to September 2020. Flies from sticky traps were identified, pooled by taxa, homogenized, and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Liquid traps were drained, and the collected fluid similarly tested after RNA concentration. We processed the contents of 133 insect traps from 40 homes, which contained over 1,345 individual insects of 11 different Diptera families and Blattodea. These individuals were grouped into 243 pools, and all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

"AB": "Remarkable progress has been made in developing intramuscular vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, they are limited with respect to eliciting local immunity in the respiratory tract, which is the primary infection site for SARS-CoV-2. To overcome the limitations of intramuscular vaccines, we constructed a nasal vaccine candidate based on an influenza vector by inserting a gene encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, named CA4-dNS1-nCoV-RBD (dNS1-RBD). A preclinical study showed that in hamsters challenged 1 d after single-dose vaccination or 9 months after booster vaccination, dNS1-RBD largely mitigated lung pathology, with no loss of body weight. Moreover, such cellular immunity is relatively unimpaired for the most concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially for the latest Omicron variant. In addition, this vaccine also provides cross-protection against H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses. The protective immune mechanism of dNS1-RBD could be attributed to the innate immune response in the nasal epithelium, local RBD-specific T cell response in the lung, and RBD-specific IgA and IgG response. Thus, this study demonstrates that the intranasally delivered dNS1-RBD vaccine candidate may offer an important addition to the fight against the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and influenza infection, compensating limitations of current intramuscular vaccines.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Science China Press."], "FAU": ["Chen, Junyu", "Wang, Pui", "Yuan, Lunzhi", "Zhang, Liang", "Zhang,

No specific treatment is currently available for COVID-19, and the discovery of effective therapeutics requires understanding the effective immunologic and immunopathologic mechanisms behind this infection. Type-I interferons (IFN-Is), as the critical elements of the immediate immune response against viral infections, can inhibit the replication and spread of the viruses. However, the available evidence shows that the antiviral IFN-I response is impaired in patients with the severe form of COVID-19. Moreover, the administration of exogenous IFN-I in different phases of the disease can lead to various outcomes. Therefore, understanding the role of IFN-I molecules in COVID-19 development and its severity can provide valuable information for better management of this disease. This review summarizes the role of IFN-Is in the pathogenesis of COIVD-19 and discusses the importance of autoantibodies against this cytokine in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and control of the subsequent excessive inflammation.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Based on experiments of one-infecting-seven COVID-19 outbreak with an index patient at bus rear, we conducted CFD simulations to investigate integrated effects of initial droplet diameters(tracer gas, 5 mum, 50 mum and 100 mum), natural air change rates per hour(ACH = 0.62, 2.27 and 5.66 h(-1) related to bus speeds) and relative humidity(RH = 35% and 95%) on pathogen-laden droplet dispersion and infection risks. Outdoor pressure difference around bus surfaces introduces natural ventilation airflow entering from bus-rear skylight and leaving from the front one. When ACH = 0.62 h(-1)(idling state), the 30-min-exposure infection risk(TIR) of tracer gas is 15.3%(bus rear) - 11.1%(bus front), and decreases to 3.1%(bus rear)-1.3%(bus front) under ACH = 5.66 h(-1)(high bus speed).The TIR of large droplets(i.e., 100 mum/50 mum) is almost independent of ACH, with a peak value( approximately 3.1%) near the index patient, because over 99.5%/97.0% of droplets deposit locally due to gravity. Moreover, 5 mum droplets can disperse further with the increasing ventilation. However, TIR for 5 mum droplets at ACH = 5.66 h(-1) stays relatively small for rear passengers(maximum 0.4%), and is even smaller in the bus middle and front(<0.1%). This study verifies that differing from general rooms, most 5 mum droplets deposit on the route through the long-and-narrow bus space with large-area surfaces(L approximately 11.4 m). Therefore, tracer gas can only simulate fine droplet with little deposition but cannot replace 5-100 mum droplet dispersion in coach buses.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Predictors of treatment response were also investigated. METHODS: This was an independent, retrospective, real-world monocentric study. We analysed the use of teriflunomide from 2016 to 2020 in patients categorized as naive or switchers, and assessed the variations in its use in men and women by age group. Clinical and MRI data of treated patients were evaluated, and NEDA-3 status at 24 and 36 months was defined. Determinants of therapeutic response were examined using regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 319 MS patients exposed to teriflunomide [209 women (65.5%)]. Of these, 67 (21%) were naive and 252 (79%) were switchers. A 20% increase of teriflunomide use in the naive group in the past two years, particularly in 2020, the first year of global Sars-Cov-2 spread, was observed. An increase of teriflunomide use of more than 10% in young women under age 45 was also reported. NEDA-3 status was calculated for 204 patients after 24 months and was achieved in 120 (58.8%) of these ones. NEDA-3 was also achieved in 92/160 (56.8%) patients at 36 months.

Here, we analyzed the evolution of the S protein as recorded in 276,712 samples collected before the start of vaccination efforts. Our analysis shows that most variants destabilize the S protein trimer, increase its conformational heterogeneity and improve the odds of the recognition by the host cell receptor. Most frequent substitutions promote overall hydrophobicity by replacing charged amino acids, reducing stabilizing local interactions in the unbound S protein trimer. Moreover, our results identify \"forbidden\" regions that rarely show any sequence variation, and which are related to conformational changes occurring upon fusion.

To date, many potential BAPs exhibiting anti-cancer activities have been documented; yet, obstacles such as their safety profiles and consumer acceptance continue to exist. Moreover, BAPs have been discovered to facilitate the suppression of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoVID-19) and maybe ideal for treating the CoVID-19 infection, as stated by published experimental findings, but their widespread knowledge is scarce. Likewise, there is a cornucopia of BAPs possessing neuroprotective effects that mend neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) by regulating gut microbiota, but they remain a subject of research interest. Additionally, a plethora of researchers have attempted next-generation approaches based on BAPs, but they need scientific attention. The text format of this critical review is organized around an overview of BAPs' versatility and diverse bio functionalities with emphasis on recent developments and novelties. The review is alienated into independent sections, which are related to either BAPs based disease management strategies or next-generation BAPs based approaches. BAPs based anti-cancer, anti-CoVID-19, and neuroprotective strategies have been explored, which may offer insights that could help the researchers and industries to find an alternate regimen against the three aforementioned fatal diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that has systematically discussed the next-generation approaches in BAP research. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the BAPs may be optimal for the management of cancer, CoVID-19, and NDs; nevertheless, experimental and preclinical studies are crucial to validate their therapeutic benefits.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

MAIN METHODS: HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing control vector, ORF8, ORF10, or M protein were assayed for cell number and markers of apoptosis at 24 h, and interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression at 14 h, with or without CBD. Cells transfected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) were also studied as a general model of RNA-type viral infection. KEY FINDINGS: Reduced cell number and increased early and late apoptosis were found when expression of viral genes was combined with 1-2 muM CBD treatment, but not in control-transfected cells treated with CBD, or in cells expressing viral genes but treated only with vehicle. In cells expressing viral genes, CBD augmented expression of IFNgamma, IFNlambda1 and IFNlambda2/3, as well as the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family members OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL. CBD also augmented expression of these genes in control cells not expressing viral genes, but without enhancing apoptosis. CBD similarly enhanced the cellular anti-viral response to Poly (I:C). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate a poor ability of HEK293 cells to respond to SARS-CoV-2 genes alone, but an augmented innate anti-viral response to these genes in the presence of CBD. Thus, CBD may prime components of the innate immune system, increasing readiness to respond to RNA-type viral infection without activating apoptosis, and could be studied for potential in prophylaxis.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

However, the direct viral infection of the gland has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the SARS-CoV-2 genome and antigens could be present in pituitary glands of lethal cases of COVID-19, and to assess possible changes in the expression of immune-related and pituitary-specific genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 genome and antigens were searched in the pituitary gland of 23 patients who died from COVID-19 and, as controls, in 12 subjects who died from trauma or sudden cardiac death. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were utilized. Levels of mRNA transcripts of immune-related and pituitary-specific genes were measured by the nCounter assay. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome and antigens were detected in 14/23 (61%) pituitary glands of the COVID-19 group, not in controls. In SARS-CoV-2-positive pituitaries, the viral genome was consistently detected by PCR in the adeno- and the neurohypophysis. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pituitary. Activation of type I interferon signaling and enhanced levels of neutrophil and cytotoxic cell scores were found in virus-positive glands. mRNA transcripts of pituitary hormones and pituitary developmental/regulatory genes were suppressed in all COVID-19 cases irrespective of virus positivity. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human pituitary and encourages exploration of pituitary dysfunction after COVID-19.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Since its start, different complications have been described thought to be related to vaccination. Here, we present a rare case where encephalopathy, myocarditis, and thrombocytopenia developed simultaneously following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-years-old female presented with fever, altered consciousness, and convulsions after taking the second shot of the vaccine. Clinical and laboratory workup was notable for the presence of thrombocytopenia and myocarditis. No alternative causes of encephalitis were found. The patient responded significantly to methylprednisolone suggesting underlying immune pathogenesis responsible for the clinical features. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were also fulfilled. CONCLUSION: Although rare, the clinician should be aware of the possible adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. Further research with large pooled data is needed to get more insight into its pathogenesis and causal relationship.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Standard COVID-19 diagnosis is confirmed using real-time qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of RT-qPCR are inversely proportional to viral load and the test indirectly quantifies viral RNA copy numbers. The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between epidemiology, clinical characteristics, severity of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and Ct values. METHODS: An observational, analytical, cross-sectional study. All children with COVID-19 under 18 years old admitted to the Ricardo Gutierrez Children's Hospital between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, were included. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 7 years. Ct values were estimated in 419 cases, median Ct value was 23.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 18.9-30.9]. Levels were significantly lower in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients (Ct: 22.1; IQR: 18.4-22.1), in children <2 years of age (Ct: 20.6; IQR: 17.3-27.3) and when sample collection was <4 days after symptom onset (Ct: 21.1; IQR: 18.1-27.5). In children >2 years of age, Ct values were significantly lower in symptomatic (Ct: 22.6; IQR: 18.7-29.3) than asymptomatic (Ct: 31.2; IQR: 24.5-33.3) patients.

METHODS: In southern Israel, 2 ethnic groups, Jewish and Bedouin, live side-by-side. Computerized data on visits for children <18 years were examined from clinics with >/=50 insured children, active both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visits were divided into in-person and remote. Monthly infectious diagnoses and dispensed antibiotic prescription rates were calculated by age (<5, 5-17 years) and ethnic groups. Mean monthly rates of 2 parallel seasons (pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods) were compared. RESULTS: Overall 2,120,253 outpatient clinic visits were recorded. Remote clinic visit rates (per 1000 children) increased from 97.04 and 33.86 in the pre-COVID-19 to 179.75 and 50.05 in the COVID-19 period in Jewish and Bedouin children, respectively ( P < 0.01) along with a reduction of in-person visit rates in both populations. Comparing pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the rates of overall infectious diagnoses in remote visits increased. Nevertheless, dispensed antibiotic prescription rates in remote visits (per 1000 visits) remained unchanged (9.84 vs. 8.67, P = 0.70, in the Jewish population and 14.32 vs. 14.17, P = 1.00, in the Bedouin population in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively) with a similar distribution of antibiotic categories. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an expansion of remote visits of children <18 years with an increase in infectious diagnoses. However, remote dispensed antibiotic prescription rates remained unchanged.

While the negative effects of school closure cannot be ignored, accumulating data suggested that it is necessary for reducing community transmission. Our study presents an optional strategy for safe school opening during a pandemic, implemented in selected Israeli high schools by a special task force constructed by the Sheba Medical Center (SMC). METHODS: The study took place between November 2020 and April 2021. Three schools from different areas of Israel were enrolled. The participants were asked to undergo bi-weekly SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic antigen tests (Ag-RDT). Those who tested positive were requested to self-isolate, whereas their school contacts were tested daily by Ag-RDT. Participants with a previously documented SARS-CoV-2 infection or who were found to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive upon enrollment were exempted from screening. RESULTS: Of a total of 361 participants who enrolled in the study, 12.3% were found to be seropositive. Fourteen SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected (3.5%), 12 of them in one single school located in an endemic area for SARS-CoV-2. The 14 cases resulted in 84 days of COVID-19-related absence from school, comparing with 1775 potential days of COVID-19-related absence under a strategy implementing self-isolation instead of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Safe continuation of academic routine during the pandemic is possible when using rapid Ag-RDT as a screening tool, while allowing swab collection by trained students and teachers.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although preprints have existed since 1961, they have gained increased popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need for immediate, relevant information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the publication rate and impact of preprints included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Science Update and assess the performance of the COVID-19 Science Update team in selecting impactful preprints. METHODS: All preprints in the first 100 editions (April 1, 2020, to July 30, 2021) of the Science Update were included in the study. Preprints that were not published were categorized as \"unpublished preprints.\" Preprints that were subsequently published exist in 2 versions (in a peer-reviewed journal and on the original preprint server), which were analyzed separately and referred to as \"peer-reviewed preprint\" and \"original preprint,\" respectively. Time to publish was the time interval between the date on which a preprint was first posted and the date on which it was first available as a peer-reviewed article. Impact was quantified by Altmetric Attention Score and citation count for all available manuscripts on August 6, 2021. Preprints were analyzed by publication status, publication rate, preprint server, and time to publication. RESULTS: Of the 275 preprints included in the CDC COVID-19 Science Update during the study period, most came from three servers: medRxiv (n=201, 73.1%), bioRxiv (n=41, 14.9%), and SSRN (n=25, 9.1%), with 8 (2.9%) coming from other sources. Additionally, 152 (55.3%) were eventually published. The median time to publish was 2.3 (IQR 1.4-3.7). When preprints posted in the last 2.3 months were excluded (to account for the time to publish), the publication rate was 67.8%. Moreover, 76 journals published at least one preprint from the CDC COVID-19 Science Update, and 18 journals published at least three. The median Altmetric Attention Score for unpublished preprints (n=123, 44.7%) was 146 (IQR 22-552) with a median citation count of 2 (IQR 0-8); for original preprints (n=152, 55.2%), these values were 212 (IQR 22-1164) and 14 (IQR 2-40), respectively; for peer-review preprints, these values were 265 (IQR 29-1896) and 19 (IQR 3-101), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies of COVID-19 preprints found publication rates between 5.4% and 21.1%. Preprints included in the CDC COVID-19 Science Update were published at a higher rate than overall COVID-19 preprints, and those that were ultimately published were published within months and received higher attention scores than unpublished preprints. These findings indicate that the Science Update process for selecting preprints had a high fidelity in terms of their likelihood to be published and their impact. The incorporation of high-quality preprints into the CDC COVID-19 Science Update improves this activity's capacity to inform meaningful public health decision-making.", "CI": ["(c)Jeremy Otridge, Cynthia L Ogden, Kyle T Bernstein, Martha Knuth, Julie", "Fishman, John T Brooks.

Objectives: Estimation of the attributable mortality of the VAP among patients with COVID-19. Methods: Using the REA-REZO surveillance network, three groups of adult medical ICU patients were computed: control group (patients admitted between 2016 and 2019; prepandemic patients), pandemic COVID-19 group (PandeCOV(+)), and pandemic non-COVID-19 group (PandeCOV(-)) admitted during 2020. The primary outcome was the estimation of attributable mortality and attributable fraction related to VAP in these patients. Using multistate modeling with causal inference, the outcomes related to VAP were also evaluated. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 64,816 patients were included in the control group, 7,442 in the PandeCOV(-) group, and 1,687 in the PandeCOV(+) group. The incidence of VAP was 14.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.9 to 14.6), 18.3 (95% CI, 17.3 to 19.4), and 31.9 (95% CI, 29.8 to 34.2) per 1,000 ventilation-days in each group, respectively. Attributable mortality at 90 days was 3.15% (95%, CI, 2.04% to 3.43%), 2.91% (95% CI, -0.21% to 5.02%), and 8.13% (95% CI, 3.54% to 12.24%), and attributable fraction of mortality at 90 days was 1.22% (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.63), 1.42% (95% CI, -0.11% to 2.61%), and 9.17% (95% CI, 3.54% to 12.24%) for the control, PandeCOV(-), and PandeCOV(+) groups, respectively. Except for the higher risk of developing VAP, the PandeCOV(-) group shared similar VAP characteristics with the control group. PandeCOV(+) patients were at lower risk of death without VAP (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74) than the control group.

Our study seeks to examine how the biophysical parameters of the Delta variant correlate to the clinical observations. Receptor binding domain (RBD) is the first point of contact with the human host cells and is the immunodominant form of the spike protein. Delta variant RBD contains two novel mutations L452R and T478K. We examined the effect of single as well as the double mutations on RBD expression in human Expi293 cells, RBD stability using urea and thermal denaturation, and RBD binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to neutralizing antibodies using isothermal titration calorimetry. Delta variant RBD showed significantly higher expression compared to the wild-type RBD, and the increased expression is due to L452R mutation. Despite their non-conservative nature, none of the mutations significantly affected RBD structure and stability. All mutants showed similar binding affinity to ACE2 and to Class 1 antibodies (CC12.1 and LY-CoV016) as that of the wild-type. Delta double mutant L452R/T478K showed no binding to Class 2 antibodies (P2B-2F6 and LY-CoV555) and a hundred-fold weaker binding to a Class 3 antibody (REGN10987), and the decreased antibody binding is determined by the L452R mutation. These results indicate that the immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, rather than increased receptor binding, is the main biophysical parameter that determined the fitness landscape of the Delta variant RBD.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzes half-hourly electricity consumption data of 35 public buildings covering 6 building types in the Perth and Kinross Council area in Scotland, U.K., over the span of 2020 and 2021. The results show that the restriction has a greater impact on the electricity reduction in the first year of the pandemic than that in the second year. In response to the restriction, the electricity use intensity of all public buildings reduces significantly (p < 0.001) except office buildings with no significant reduction (p > 0.05); secondary schools have the highest electricity consumption reduction (275.04 kwh/day), while museums have the lowest reduction (58.62 kwh/day). In addition, the electricity consumption and electricity use intensity of museum, library and school buildings are inversely proportional to the restriction intensity, while this is opposite for office buildings. Combing restriction intensity and mobility data, this research reveals the different impacts of the restriction policies on the electricity consumption of public buildings during the pandemic, which reflects people's changing attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19. The results provide a reference basis for energy management to develop more realistic energy demand policies based on public building types and to optimize the electricity supply load and energy profile during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying the disease outcomes, short and long-term sequelae may help to establish an evidence-based prevention and education policy for sick days management and DKA prevention. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to describe clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, adolescents, and young adults with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) and explore the effects of COVID-19 on glycemic control and disease course. METHODS: An observational study was conducted at 3 pediatric diabetes clinics in Israel between mid-March 2020 and mid-March 2021. Included were young people with established T1D, age younger than 30 years, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Data were collected from medical files, diabetes devices, and COVID-19 questionnaire. Outcome measures were analyzed by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms (symptomatic/asymptomatic) and by age group (pediatric, < 19 years/young adults, 19-30 years). RESULTS: Of 132 patients, mean age 16.9 +/- 5.3years, with COVID-19-confirmed infection, 103 (78%) had related symptoms; the most common were headaches, fatigue, fever, and loss of sense of smell. All had a mild disease course, but 4 required hospitalization and 2 cases were directly related to COVID-19 infection (pleuropneumonia in a patient with immunodeficiency syndrome, 1 case of diabetic ketoacidosis). Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .033), elevated glucose levels (OR = 5.23; 95% CI, 1.12-24.41; P = .035), and comorbidities (OR = 8.21; 95% CI, 1.00-67.51; P = .050) were positively associated with symptomatic infection. Persistent symptoms occurred in 16.5% of the cohort over a median of 6.7 months; age (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29; P = .030) and elevated glucose levels (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.12-10.40; P = .031) were positively associated with persistent symptoms. Usually, no change was reported in glucose levels (64%) except for a temporary deterioration in glycemic control during the short infection period. CONCLUSION: Young people with established T1D experience mild COVID-19 infection. Elevated glucose levels during COVID-19 infection and older age were associated with prolonged disease course.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2022.

However, clinical evaluations are still sparse. Thus, we evaluated a wide variety of antiseptic agents that can be used as mouthrinses for their antiviral effects in vitro and their respective mode of action. One of the most promising antiseptic agents (benzalkoniumchloride, BAC) was used in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with subsequent analysis of viral loads by RT-qPCR and virus rescue in cell culture. Mechanistic analysis revealed that treatment with BAC and other antiseptic agents efficiently inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by primarily disrupting the viral envelope, without affecting viral RNA integrity. However, the clinical application only resulted in a mild reduction of viral loads in the oral cavity. These results indicate that gargling with mouthrinses comprising single antiseptic agents may play a minor role towards a potential reduction of transmission rates and thus, these findings are of utmost importance when considering alternative COVID-19 prevention strategies.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022.

A decline in family financial level can adversely affect adolescents' mental health. This study examined the association between perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among South Korean adolescents. METHODS: Data from 54,948 middle and high school students from the 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey were collected in this cross-sectional study. The effect of the perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 related to GAD was analyzed using binary and multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The relationship between perceived family financial decline due to COVID-19 and GAD was linear with increasing odds ratios and confidence intervals (the possibility of GAD, no financial decline: OR 1.00, mild: OR 1.11, CI 1.05-1.17, moderate: OR 1.30, CI 1.22-1.39, severe: OR 1.48, CI 1.34-1.63). Girls, low-income class, and living with family were vulnerable to GAD. GAD levels of mild, moderate, and severe were most likely to occur in each case of mild, moderate, and severe financial decline, respectively. LIMITATIONS: As this is a cross-sectional study, causality is unknown. Because this study data was self-reported by adolescents, they may have been overestimated or underestimated. CONCLUSION: GAD in adolescents is closely related to perceived decreased family finances due to COVID-19. The dose-response of GAD according to financial decline became gradually severe. Anxious adolescents were afraid of uncertain and adverse outcomes affecting them or their families. Therefore, there is a vital need to care for financially affected adolescents.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the efficiencies and mechanisms of virus removal in the units of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are summarized and compared, among which the inactivation efficiencies of typical viruses by typical disinfection approaches under varied operational conditions are elucidated. Subsequently, the occurrence and removal of viruses in treated effluent reuse and desalination, as well as that in sewage sludge treatment, are discussed. Potential dissemination of viruses is emphasized by occurrence via aerosolization from toilets, the collection system and WWTP aeration, which might have a vital role in the transmission and spread of viruses.

The recent trend of vaccinating against COVID-19 pandemic reveals a strong control of infectious disease. On the other hand, it is observed in some countries that, the vaccine application offers less control over the spread of virus, since some portion of vaccinated people is not totally protected/immuned and viable to infection again after a while due to weak/loss immunity offered by the vaccine. This requires transition from vaccinated department to infected for COVID-19. This character of COVID-19 helps us reconsideration of the vaccinated department by letting some part of it being exposed to the infection again. Taking this into account, as a result of modification of the SIR model, the epidemiology is now governed with three main epidemic dimensionless parameters, having provided an initial fraction of infected individuals. The dimensionless model with these parameters is analyzed initially from the stability point of view. The effects of weak immunity are then illustrated numerically on some chosen parameter range. How some of the countries applying the COVID-19 vaccine programs affected by weak/loss immunity is eventually examined with the modified model. The rate of vaccination as well as the basic Reproduction number are found to affect the epidemic demography of the population subject to weak or loss of immunity. In the case of a high vaccination rate, the countries are not anticipated to be highly influenced by the weak immunity of low level, whereas weak immunity prolongs the contagious disease by appearance of secondary multiple peaks in the epidemic compartments with relatively small vaccination rates and basic Reproductive numbers.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, its long-lasting effects on both mental health and decision-making difficulties remain unexplored. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of psychological disorders in Italy's populace one-year after the outbreak; further, we investigated potential risks impacting mental health and decision-making. METHODS: In March 2021, 586 individuals (18-73 years) completed an online-survey plus a computerized delay discounting task for hypothetical money rewards. RESULTS: Psychological symptoms prevalence exceeded the Italy's lockdown rates, with about one-third reporting moderate-to-extremely severe depression, another third anxiety, and the rest stress; mirrored by an increase of symptoms at clinically significant severity levels. One year into the pandemic, half of our sample presented at least one psychological problem, and one-third was at risk of developing a more clinically severe psychological outcome. Fear of job loss, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty were among the major risk factors to mental health. Plus, social-relationships and financial uncertainty were key determinants of depression, while fear of COVID-19 infection predicted anxiety symptoms. For decision-making tendencies, elevated delay discounting rates, implying less future-oriented behaviors, were mostly predicted by increased job loss fear and older age (>35 years). LIMITATIONS: This study provides cross-sectional evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Depression, anxiety and stress levels were still alarming one-year into COVID-19. Individuals experiencing financial insecurity, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty perhaps benefit most from early interventions.

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and associations of these coping strategies with depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. METHODS: 8320 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between June 22, 2020 and May 10, 2021 completed an online survey including questions about coping strategies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and current depression and anxiety symptoms. We used weighted regression to estimate prevalence ratios for moderate/severe depression and anxiety symptom severity associated with coping strategies. RESULTS: The most common coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress were talking with friends and family (77%), outdoor physical activity (54%), and increasing screen time activities (52%). Exercising using online programs or videos, outdoor physical activity, talking with friends and family, and engaging in more family activities were associated with 29% to 38% lower prevalence of moderate/severe depression symptom severity and 16% to 34% lower prevalence of moderate/severe anxiety symptom severity. LIMITATION: We are unable to rule out reverse temporality as an explanation for the observed results because of the cross-sectional design; depression or anxiety symptom severity may influence use of specific coping strategies.

However, its preparation process is complex and time-consuming. Herein, we fabricated an innovative hydrophilic rhodamine B-loaded / boronic acid-modified graphene oxide (HRBGO) nanocomposite, used as a substitute of enzyme-labeled second antibody. The synthetic HRBGO was loaded with generous rhodamine B and modified with boronic acid. Therefore, the HRBGO could selectively label the carbohydrate chains of Fc fragment of primary antibody through specific boronate affinity recognition, and then perform signal output and amplification by releasing rhodamine B. To verify the practicability of HRBGO, trastuzumab as a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) was selected as model antibody. A glycosylation site-blocked / HER2-immobilized magnetic nanoparticles (GHMN) was also prepared for selectively capturing trastuzumab from complex samples via specific immunoaffinity. Because the glycosylation sites of HER2 can also be labeled with the HRBGO by boronate affinity recognition, these sites were blocked by a masking agent to minimize the background signal. For specific and ultrasensitive detection of trastuzumab, the integration of GHMN and HRBGO was proposed and optimized in detail. Trastuzumab detection based on HRBGO consisted of three steps: specific capture, selective labeling, and output signal. The proposed strategy provided ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection of 0.35 fg mL(-1) and was successfully applied in the detection of trastuzumab in spiked serum sample with recovery and relative standard deviation in the range of 98.7-103.8% and 3.8-6.0%, respectively. To assess universal applicability, the HRBGO was also successfully used for the determination of anti-SARS-COV2 RBD antibody in human serum sample.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The inter- and intra-personal mechanisms by which disrupted routine can contribute to elevated depressive symptoms has not been well-explored. The present study aimed to examine how feelings of social (dis)connectedness and rumination, as a maladaptive coping strategy, could explain the association between disrupted well-being activities and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N = 496) ranging in age from 18 to 73 years (M = 28.73, SD = 10.93) completed an online survey within the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included measures of disruption to usual psychological and physical well-being activities, social connectedness, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness and rumination were investigated as serial mediators of the association between disrupted well-being activities and depression using Hayes' PROCESS macro. RESULTS: 39.5% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of depression. Disruption to well-being activities predicted higher depressive symptoms, and this was partially explained by feelings of social disconnectedness and subsequent rumination. Rumination, alone, was not a significant mediator between disrupted routine and depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional survey design does not preclude the possibility of bidirectional effects. CONCLUSION: The social distancing public health measures to combat COVID-19 have contributed to widespread disrupted routine, and in turn, elevated symptoms of depression. Social disconnectedness plays a particularly important role in this association. Intervention strategies should consider social factors as a 'social cure' for mass, positive mental health promotion during COVID-19.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

This study aim was to investigate the microbial contamination present in the waste collection trucks (WCT) and in the support facilities (waste collection station - WCS). It was applied a multi-approach protocol using active (air sampling by impingement and impaction) and passive (surface swabs, electrostatic dust cloths and settled dust) sampling methods. The screening of azole-resistance, the investigation of mycotoxins and the assessment of the elicited biological responses in vitro were also carried out aiming recognizing the possible health effects of waste collection drivers. SARS-CoV-2 detection was also performed. In WCS only air samples had contamination in all the four sampling sites (canteen, operational removal core, operational removal center, and administrative service). Among all the analyzed matrices from the WCT a higher percentage of total bacterial counts and Gram-was detected in swabs (66.93%; 99.36%). In WCS the most common species were Penicillium sp. (43.98%) and Cladosporium sp. (24.68%), while on WCT Aspergillus sp. (4.18%) was also one of the most found. In the azole resistance screening Aspergillus genera was not observed in the azole-supplemented media. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the environmental samples collected, but Aspergillus section Fumigati was detected in 5 samples. Mycotoxins were not detected in EDC from WCS, while in WCT they were detected in filters (N = 1) and in settled dust samples (N = 16). In conclusion, our study reveals that a comprehensive sampling approach using active and passive sampling (e.g. settled dust sampling for a representative mycotoxin evaluation) and combined analytic methods (i.e., culture-based and molecular) is an important asset in microbial exposure assessments. Concerning the waste collection exposure scenario, the results of this study unveiled a complex exposure, particularly to fungi and their metabolites.

This study takes a lead to investigate whether and how general anxiety will influence college students' e-learning intention to provide knowledge to better improve the e-learning technology. METHODS: We adopted the Technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine the difference between students with and without general anxiety in the e-learning intention where the students are classified based on the General Anxiety Disorder-2 scale. The model is empirically analyzed based on a survey of 512 college students in China regarding their e-learning experience in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that the TAM is powerful in explaining the e-learning intention among college students with general anxiety. Besides, all effects associated with perceived usefulness (PU) are reinforced while those associated with perceived ease of use (PEOU) are attenuated in the anxiety group. The results suggest that instructors and higher education institutions should take advantage of the significant PU-intention relationship by providing quality e-learning, which is paramount to coping with the general anxiety among students. LIMITATIONS: This study provides a prototype attempt to investigate the influence of anxiety on e-learning where the different types of anxiety sources are synthesized. However, anxiety can stem from internal sources (computer anxiety, academic stress) and external sources (fear of the virus, lack of social interaction), which requires further investigations.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined whether baseline perceived emotional intelligence (EI) predicted PTG through self-esteem and emotional regulation (ER) in a five-month follow-up study conducted on Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Validated measures were completed by 2090 participants, which assessed both the perceived EI and the PTG 1 month after a nationwide lockdown in China, with 1609 of these participating in the follow-up five months later. Structural equation models (SEM) were then used to explore the paths between the variables. RESULTS: As hypothesized, the follow-up survey found that the baseline perceived EI predicted PTG, ER, and self-esteem outcomes. The SEM analyses also revealed that self-esteem and ER significantly mediated the association between EI and PTG. LIMITATIONS: Studies of three or more waves may be more suitable for longitudinal mediation analyses. Self-assessment reports may have subjective effects.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mediation effects of depressive symptoms, emotional competence, and COVID-related PTSS on the relationship between family functioning and NSSI in adolescents. METHOD: A sample of 5854 adolescents was recruited from June 16 to July 8, 2020. The data for family functioning, depressive symptoms, emotional competence, COVID-related PTSS, and NSSI behavior of adolescents were collected via self-reported questionnaires. A structural equation model was constructed to examine the relationship, and a bootstrap analysis was conducted to evaluate the mediation effects. RESULTS: The reporting rate of adolescent NSSI was 30.2%. The poor family functioning was positively associated with adolescent NSSI (beta = 0.130, 95% CI = 0.093-0.182), which was mediated by depression with effect size of 0.231 (95% CI = 0.201-0.257). The pathway coefficients between emotional competence and NSSI, and depression, COVID-related PTSS and NSSI, though statistically significant were unlikely to be clinically meaning with values of 0.057 and 0.015. There was no mediating effect by COVID-related PTSS. The pathways initially constructed between family functioning and COVID-related PTSS, emotional capacity and COVID-related PTSS were not been verified. LIMITATIONS: It was unclear whether this mediational effect would be supported in a longitudinal design. The application and extension of this model toward other regions and countries, and different ages need to be further explored. CONCLUSION: The interventions of adolescent NSSI should focus on both the family level and individual levels. Improving family environment, screening depressive symptoms, enhancing emotional competence and lessening COVID-related PTSS may reduce NSSI.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we assessed depressive symptom levels before the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2018 to December 2019, and during the pandemic in Italy in 2020. METHODS: We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), which is a screening instrument devised to detect probable depression and which has been annually administered in the framework of the Italian Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System since 2008. Depressive symptoms were assessed in a sample of 41,362 18-64-year-old adults surveyed in 2018-2019 and in a sample of 14,612 adults surveyed in 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased from 6.1% (95% CI 5.8%-6.4%) in 2018-2019 to 7.1% (95% CI 5.6%-8.6%) in March-April 2020. It then declined in May-June to 4.4% (95% CI 3.2%-5.5%) but in July-August it once again increased to 8.2% (95% CI 6.0%-10.4%) and, finally, gradually returned above the pre-lockdown level by November-December 2020 (5.9%; 95% CI 4.7%-7.1%). Compared to before the health crisis, during the pandemic, women and individuals with financial difficulties were found to have a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms while younger, individuals with a higher education and those living in South Italy became increasingly vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: While the average response to the pandemic was one of resilience over time, women and younger individuals were found to be particularly prone to the risk of depressive symptoms, as a result of the pandemic.

With in-person away rotations prohibited and interviews held virtually, orthopaedic residency programs turned to social media. Studies document the exponential growth of residency program Instagram accounts after March 2020, but few analyze the content of their posts. This study provides an updated assessment of such Instagram accounts including a detailed analysis of their content and a discussion of potentially concerning posts. METHODS: Orthopaedic surgery residency programs participating in the National Resident Matching Program and any Instagram accounts associated with these programs were identified. Instagram accounts were analyzed, and the 25 most recent posts and all highlighted stories for each account were coded for content based on a predetermined list of categories. Specific attention was given to content that may raise legal, ethical, or professionalism concerns. The primary outcome was the most common content code among posts. The secondary outcomes were the number of posts identified as potentially concerning and the types of concerns represented. RESULTS: Overall, 138 of 193 residency programs (72%) had an Instagram account at the time of cross-sectional analysis, 65% of which were created between April and December 2020. All accounts were public. Profiles had on average 1,156 +/- 750 followers and 59 +/- 75 posts. Of the 3,348 posts analyzed, the most common coded themes were resident introductions (33%), camaraderie (27%), and social life and hobbies (26%). There were 81 concerning posts from 52 separate accounts. Seventy-five of the concerning posts (93%) depicted residents scrubbed alone. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic residency Instagram accounts are potential tools for residency recruitment and can depict a program's culture through posts over time. However, public accounts are open to scrutiny by other viewers, including patients and their families. Care must be taken to consider multiple perspectives of post content, so as to bolster, not damage, the residency program's reputation.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons."], "FAU": ["Bixby, Elise C", "Danford, Nicholas C", "Desai, Sohil S", "Paskey, Taylor L", "Levine, William N"], "AU": ["Bixby EC", "Danford NC", "Desai SS", "Paskey TL", "Levine WN"], "AUID": ["ORCID: 0000-0003-3385-5454"], "AD": ["From the Department of Orthopedics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."], "LA": ["eng"], "PT": ["Journal Article"], "DEP": "20220425", "PL": "United States", "TA": "J Am Acad Orthop Surg", "JT": "The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons", "JID": "9417468", "SB": "IM", "MH": ["*COVID-19", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "*Internship and Residency", "*Orthopedic Procedures", "Pandemics"], "EDAT": "2022/04/27 06:00", "MHDA": "2022/07/12 06:00", "CRDT": ["2022/04/26 17:17"], "PHST": ["2022/01/25 00:00 [received]", "2022/03/17 00:00 [accepted]", "2022/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]", "2022/07/12 06:00 [medline]", "2022/04/26 17:17 [entrez]"], "AID": ["10.5435/JAAOS-D-22-00089 [doi]", "00124635-202207150-00003 [pii]"], "PST": "ppublish", "SO": "J Am Acad Orthop Surg. 2022 Jul 15;30(14):648-657. doi: 10.5435/JAAOS-D-22-00089.

Whereas the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine and adenovirus-vectored vaccine was similar between PWH in stable condition and healthy adults, the effects of inactivated vaccines are not known. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study in real-world setting. METHODS: Adult PWH in care and planning to receive either inactivated (day 0 and day 28) or mRNA-based (day 0 and day 21) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 were recruited, with blood samples collected over 6 months for surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Demographic and clinical data including age, sex, CD4 + cell count, and suppressed viral load (SVL) status were transcribed for analyses, by simple and multivariable linear regression models, and multivariable linear generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: A total of 611 HIV patients, 91% male patients, were recruited, of whom 423 and 184 have received mRNA-based and inactivated vaccine, respectively. The seroconversion rate was 99% for mRNA-based vs, 86% for inactivated vaccine [odds ratio (OR) = 21.56, P = 0.004]. At 6 months, mRNA-based vaccine continued to give a higher response (94 vs. 57%, P < 0.001). The temporal pattern varied between the two vaccines. By GEE, mRNA-based vaccine ( B = 40.59, P < 0.001) and latest SVL status ( B = 10.76, P = 0.01) were positively associated with sVNT level, but not latest CD4 + cell count. CONCLUSION: In HIV patients, inactivated vaccine gave a lower peak and shorter duration of sVNT responses compared with mRNA vaccine.

The long-term impact of lockdown measures on the general population may vary. We aimed to identify and characterize self-reported mental and physical health trajectories in the French population from pre-lockdown to the first and second COVID-19 lockdowns and to identify factors associated with health status variation patterns. METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of the MAVIE cohort in France. Volunteers of this national cohort were recruited between November 2014 and December 2019, and information was collected at recruitment (pre-lockdown), April-May 2020 (the first lockdown), and October-December 2020 (the second lockdown). Latent class mixed models were built to identify distinct anxiety (as measured by GAD-7) and depressive (as measured by PHQ-9) symptoms, and self-perceived mental and physical health trajectories. Factors associated with status variation were identified by logistic or multinomial regression. RESULTS: A total of 613 participants with data in all three data collection waves were included. Respondents spent almost half as much time on traditional media, websites and social media during the second lockdown as during the first. Mean anxiety scores were 1.96, 2.37 and 2.82 at pre-lockdown, and the first and second lockdowns, respectively. Mean depressive scores were 3.12, 3.36 and 3.95, respectively. Latent class mixed models fitted two and three distinct trajectory classes respectively for anxiety symptoms ('no pre-pandemic anxiety, slightly increase', 58.9%; 'consistently fair', 41.1%) and depressive symptoms ('consistently very low', 34.6%; 'consistently low', 56.1%; 'increasing and clinically significant at the second lockdown', 9.3%), and four classes for self-perceived mental and physical health. Females were more likely to belong to trajectories of the most vulnerable one as regard to the symptoms of anxiety and depression, and self-perceived mental and physical health. The younger participants were also more vulnerable to anxiety symptoms and those with a clinical diagnosis or a positive COVID-19 test for the participant or relatives were more likely to belong to vulnerable trajectories for depressive symptoms and self-perceived mental health. CONCLUSION: A continuing increase in the mean scores of anxiety and depression symptoms was observed throughout the two lockdown periods in France. Further analyses revealed distinct patterns with a small fraction of volunteers experiencing worsening mental and physical health symptoms.

The projection is carried out for years 2019-2023 and covers an (estimated) full process of pre-pandemic, pandemic outbreak, and recovery phase and provides essential information for determining the complete phase impact of the COVID-19. Two scenarios, i.e. the recovery scenario and the business as usual scenario, are set to investigate the water use and wastewater generation characteristics after the pandemic. The results imply that in both scenarios, the water use in China shows a V-shaped trend from 2019 to 2023 and reached a low point in 2020 of 5,81310(8) m(3). The wastewater discharge shows an increasing trend throughout the COVID period in both scenarios.

However, very few studies have investigated the potential health effects of coexposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) and bioaerosols through the transmission of infectious agents, particularly under the current circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to identify urinary metabolite biomarkers that might serve as clinically predictive or diagnostic standards for relevant diseases in a real-time manner. We performed an unbiased gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/LC-MS) approach to detect urinary metabolites in 92 samples from young healthy individuals collected at three different time points after exposure to clean air, polluted ambient, or purified air, as well as two additional time points after air repollution or repurification. Subsequently, we compared the metabolomic profiles between the two time points using an integrated analysis, along with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes-enriched pathway and time-series analysis. We identified 33 and 155 differential metabolites (DMs) associated with PM and bioaerosol exposure using GC/LC-MS and follow-up analyses, respectively. Our findings suggest that 16-dehydroprogesterone and 4-hydroxyphenylethanol in urine samples may serve as potential biomarkers to predict or diagnose PM- or bioaerosol-related diseases, respectively. The results indicated apparent differences between PM- and bioaerosol-associated DMs at five different time points and revealed dynamic alterations in the urinary metabolic profiles of young healthy humans with cyclic exposure to clean and polluted air environments. Our findings will help in investigating the detrimental health effects of short-term coexposure to airborne PM and bioaerosols in a real-time manner and improve clinically predictive or diagnostic strategies for preventing air pollution-related diseases.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

The increased access and persistent Internet use could heighten the risk of problematic Internet use (PIU) that has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for academic engagement. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between PIU and academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia) in early, middle, and late adolescence. METHODS: In all, 4852 adolescents (51.5% females; Mage = 13.80 +/- 2.38) from different regions of Chinese mainland participated in the study and completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Depression and then insomnia as well as anxiety and then insomnia mediated the relationship between PIU and academic engagement. Anxiety exhibited a double-edged effect, that is, a positive relation with academic engagement directly and a negative relation with academic engagement indirectly through insomnia. Multigroup analyses showed that the indirect effects of PIU on academic engagement through depression and subsequent insomnia in middle and late adolescence were stronger than that in early adolescence, whereas the direct effect in early adolescence was stronger than that in middle adolescence. LIMITATION: This study was cross-sectional in design and relied upon self-report measures. CONCLUSION: These findings improve the understandings of how PIU relates to academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms and highlight developmental differences of adolescence.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: We investigated the safety and efficacy of PGE1 in adults receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II pilot trial at two medical intensive care units at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Adults with venovenous ECMO were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of 5 ng/kg/min PGE1 or placebo (0.9% saline) in addition to standard anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the rate of transfused packed red blood cells per ECMO day. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of and time to clinically overt bleeding and thromboembolic events. A post hoc subgroup analysis included only patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Between September 2016 and April 2021, of 133 screened patients, 50 patients were randomized, of whom 48 received the assigned study medication (24 per group). The transfusion rate was similar between groups (0.41 vs. 0.39; P = 0.733). PGE1 was associated with fewer thromboembolic events (7 vs. 16; P = 0.020) and longer thromboembolism-free time (hazard ratio [HR], 0.302; P = 0.01), fewer clinically overt bleeding events (2 vs. 11; P = 0.017), and longer bleeding-free time (HR, 0.213; P = 0.047). In patients with COVID-19 (n = 25), the HRs for clinically overt bleeding and thromboembolism were 0.276 (95% confidence interval, 0.035-2.186) and 0.521 (95% confidence interval, 0.149-1.825), respectively. Conclusions: Add-on treatment with PGE1 was safe but did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing the rate of red blood cell transfusions in patients receiving venovenous ECMO. Larger studies need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of additional PGE1 in ECMO.

In addition, a light-up RNA aptamer is used for signal amplification. STAR can detect viral RNA in less than 30 min with high specificity and sensitivity. By testing of 60 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 samples, the STAR assay demonstrates an excellent sensitivity and specificity of 96.7% and 100%, respectively. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence of the broad applicability of this assay through the multiplex detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G mutation) and direct detection of bacterial 16S rRNA.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring the specificity and the amount of antibody produced by the host immune system with high throughput and accuracy is critical to develop timely diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. Motivated by finding an easy-to-use and cost-effective alternative to existing serological methodologies for multiplex analysis, we develop a proof-of-concept multiplex nanoplasmonic biosensor to capture the humoral response in serums against multiple antigens. Nanoplasmonic sensing relies on the wavelength shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of gold nanostructures upon binding interactions between the antibodies and the immobilized antigens. Here the antigens are first immobilized on different sensing areas by using a mono-biotinylation system based on the high affinity interaction between biotin and streptavidin. We then validate the multiplex platform by detecting the presence of 3 monoclonal antibodies against 3 antigens (2 different hemagglutinins (HAs) from influenza viruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD (receptor binding domain)). We also measure the humoral response in murine sera collected before and after its immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, in good agreement with the results obtained by the ELISA assay. Our nanoplasmonic assays have successfully demonstrated multiple serum antibody profiling, which can be further integrated with microfluidics as an effective high throughput screening platform in future studies for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

So far, phosphorus-based drugs have been proposed. These drugs have good inhibitory activity against the main protease (Mpro). Hence, in order to introduce a group of inhibitors the coronavirus, 51 compounds containing different mono, bis, and tetra phosphonates as Remdesivir derivatives, 32 of which are new, were synthesized and characterized by (31)P, (13)C, and (1)H NMR and IR spectroscopy. Their biological activities were also investigated by Molecular Docking, QSAR, and Pharmacophore. Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions were studied for all compounds as well as binding energy ( big up tri, openG, Kcal/mole) and the inhibitory constant Ki (muM) obtained by Molecular Docking. The results showed that the topology of the ligands and the change of the different groups attached to them can be effective in the placement position in the active site of the enzyme (Glu 166 and Gln 189). And bisphosphonates have a high interaction tendency with Mpro COVID-19. Compound L24 was identified as the best inhibitor with the -6.38 kcal/mol binding energy. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) findings demonstrated that the polarity and topology of molecules in all phosphonate derivatives were important parameters affecting the effecting on the binding energy and inhibitory ability of compounds. The DFT and pharmacophore results are in good accordance with those of QSAR and molecular docking.

The eligible subjects were 105 general university students (60 females, aged from 19 to 27 years) undergoing brain MRI scanning and baseline behavioral tests (October 2019 to January 2020), whom were re-contacted for COVID-related vicarious traumatization measurement (February to April 2020) and follow-up general distress evaluation (March to April 2021). We applied a connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) approach to identify the functional connectome supporting vicarious traumatization based on a 268-region-parcellation assigned to network memberships. The CPM analyses showed that only the negative network model stably predicted individuals' vicarious traumatization scores (q(2) = -0.18, MSE = 617, r [predicted, actual] = 0.18, p = 0.024), with the contributing functional connectivity primarily distributed in the fronto-parietal, default mode, medial frontal, salience, and motor network. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that vicarious traumatization mediated the influence of brain functional connectome on general distress. Importantly, our results were independent of baseline family socioeconomic status, other stressful life events and general mental health as well as age, sex and head motion.

Cystatin C (Cys C) has been proposed as a potential glomerular filtration rate (GFR) marker for the early detection of acute kidney injury and CKD. However, most traditional methods for Cys C detection are immunoassays using serum as a sample and are tedious to perform and economically burdensome. To diagnose the disease in the early stage and carry out daily management during the current pandemic, we developed an integration of hydrogel microneedle patch (HMNP) and lateral flow cassette (LFC) to rapidly detect Cys C in skin interstitial fluid (ISF) in 25 min for blood-free CKD management anytime and anywhere by the naked eye that can reduce the impact of an individual's quality of life and life expectancy.

Electrochemical sensors are a viable choice to fill this role but still require improvements to the signal magnitude, especially for early detection and low viral loads. Herein, finite element analysis of a novel biosensor concept for single virion counting using a generator-collector microelectrode design is presented. The proposed design combines a redox-cycling amplified electrochemical current with electrophoresis-driven electrode-particle collision for rapid virus detection. The effects of experimental (e.g. scan rate, collector bias) and geometric factors are studied to optimize the sensor design. Two generator-collector configurations are explored: a ring-disk configuration to analyze sessile droplets and an interdigitated electrode (IDE) design housed in a microchannel. For the ring-disk configuration, we calculate an amplification factor of approximately 5 and collector efficiency of approximately 0.8 for a generator-collector spacing of 600 nm. For the IDE, the collector efficiency is even larger, approaching unity. The dual-electrode mode is critical for increasing the current and electric field strength. As a result, the current steps upon virus capture are more than an order of magnitude larger compared to single-mode. Additionally, single virus capture times are reduced from over 700 s down to approximately 20 s. Overall, the frequency of virus capture and magnitude of the electrochemical current steps depend on the virus properties and electrode configuration, with the IDE capable of single virus detection within seconds owing to better particle confinement in the microchannel.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

To be effective, policy decision-makers must know whether these passports will be widely accepted by the public and under what conditions. This study focuses attention on immunity passports, as these may prove useful in countries both with and without an existing COVID-19 vaccination program; however, our general findings also extend to vaccination passports. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess attitudes toward the introduction of immunity passports in six countries, and determine what social, personal, and contextual factors predicted their support. METHODS: We collected 13,678 participants through online representative sampling across six countries-Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom-during April to May of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and assessed attitudes and support for the introduction of immunity passports. RESULTS: Immunity passport support was moderate to low, being the highest in Germany (775/1507 participants, 51.43%) and the United Kingdom (759/1484, 51.15%); followed by Taiwan (2841/5989, 47.44%), Australia (963/2086, 46.16%), and Spain (693/1491, 46.48%); and was the lowest in Japan (241/1081, 22.94%). Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects modeling was used to assess predictive factors for immunity passport support across countries. International results showed neoliberal worldviews (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.22), personal concern (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.16), perceived virus severity (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14), the fairness of immunity passports (OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.36-2.66), liking immunity passports (OR 2.77, 95% CI 2.61-2.94), and a willingness to become infected to gain an immunity passport (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.51-1.68) were all predictive factors of immunity passport support. By contrast, gender (woman; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.82-0.98), immunity passport concern (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.57-0.65), and risk of harm to society (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76) predicted a decrease in support for immunity passports. Minor differences in predictive factors were found between countries and results were modeled separately to provide national accounts of these data. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that support for immunity passports is predicted by the personal benefits and societal risks they confer. These findings generalized across six countries and may also prove informative for the introduction of vaccination passports, helping policymakers to introduce effective COVID-19 passport policies in these six countries and around the world.", "CI": ["(c)Paul M Garrett, Joshua P White, Simon Dennis, Stephan Lewandowsky, Cheng-Ta", "Yang, Yasmina Okan, Andrew Perfors, Daniel R Little, Anastasia Kozyreva, Philipp", "Lorenz-Spreen, Takashi Kusumi, Yoshihisa Kashima.

The presence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus can potentially impact therapeutic and diagnostic test performances. We design and develop here a unique set of DNA probes i.e., antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) which can interact with genetic sequences of the virus irrespective of its ongoing mutations. The probes, developed herein, target a specific segment of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 with high binding efficiency which do not mutate among the known variants. Further probing into the interaction profile of the ASOs reveals that the ASO-RNA hybridization remains unaltered even for a hypothetical single point mutation at the target RNA site and diminished only in case of the hypothetical double or triple point mutations. The mechanism of interaction among the ASOs and SARS-CoV-2 RNA is then explored with a combination of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and machine learning techniques. It has been observed that the technique, described herein, could efficiently discriminate between clinically positive and negative samples with approximately 100% sensitivity and approximately 90% specificity up to 63 copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration. Thus, this study establishes N gene targeted ASOs as the fundamental machinery to efficiently detect all the current SARS-CoV-2 variants regardless of their mutations.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

These drastic changes in daily life, enforced through national lockdowns, led to abrupt reductions of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in urbanized areas all over the world. To examine the effect of social restrictions on local emissions of CO2, we analysed district level CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance technique from 13 stations in 11 European cities. The data span several years before the pandemic until October 2020 (six months after the pandemic began in Europe). All sites showed a reduction in CO2 emissions during the national lockdowns. The magnitude of these reductions varies in time and space, from city to city as well as between different areas of the same city. We found that, during the first lockdowns, urban CO2 emissions were cut with respect to the same period in previous years by 5% to 87% across the analysed districts, mainly as a result of limitations on mobility.

Here we present a single-step nanocoating process to endow commercial face mask filters with photobiocidal activity, triboelectric filtration capability, and washability.

The transparent Si-Al matrix strongly immobilized the photosensitizer molecules while dispersing them spatially, thus suppressing self-quenching. During nanolayer formation, PFOTES was anisotropically rearranged on the Si-Al matrix, promoting moisture resistance and triboelectric charging of the Si-Al/PFOTES-CV (SAPC)-coated filter. The SAPC nanolayer stabilized the photoexcited state of the photosensitizer and promoted redox reaction. Compared to pure-photosensitizer-coated filters, the SAPC filter showed substantially higher photobiocidal efficiency ( approximately 99.99 % for bacteria and a virus) and photodurability ( approximately 83 % reduction in bactericidal efficiency for the pure-photosensitizer filter but approximately 0.34 % for the SAPC filter after 72 h of light irradiation). Moreover, after five washes with detergent, the SAPC filter maintained its photobiocidal and filtration performance, proving its reusability potential.

Compared with traditional public health surveillance, harnessing the rich data from social media, including Twitter, has been considered a useful tool and can overcome the limitations of the traditional surveillance system. This paper proposes an intelligent COVID-19 early warning system using Twitter data with novel machine learning methods. We use the natural language processing (NLP) pre-training technique, i.e., fine-tuning BERT as a Twitter classification method. Moreover, we implement a COVID-19 forecasting model through a Twitter-based linear regression model to detect early signs of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we develop an expert system, an early warning web application based on the proposed methods.

However, transitioning surveillance approaches to small populations, such as dormitories and assisted living facilities poses challenges including difficulties with sample collection and processing. Recently, the need for reliable and timely data has coincided with the need for precise local forecasting of the trajectory of COVID-19. This study compared wastewater and clinical data from the University of Delaware (Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters), and evaluated wastewater collection practices for enhanced virus detection sensitivity. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur in infected individuals. However, shedding concentrations and duration has been shown to vary. Therefore, three shedding periods (14, 21, and 30 days) were presumed and included for analysis of wastewater data. SARS-CoV-2 levels detected in wastewater correlated with clinical virus detection when a positive clinical test result was preceded by fecal shedding of 21 days (p< 0.05) and 30 days (p < 0.05), but not with new cases (p = 0.09) or 14 days of shedding (p = 0.17). Discretely collected wastewater samples were compared with 24-hour composite samples collected at the same site. The discrete samples (n = 99) were composited examining the influence of sampling duration and time of day on SARS-CoV-2 detection. SARS-CoV-2 detection varied among dormitory complexes and sampling durations of 3-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour (controls). Collection times frequently showing high detection values were between the hours of 03:00 to 05:00 and 23:00 to 08:00. In each of these times of day 33% of samples (3/9) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the control sample. The remainder (6/9) of the collection times (3-hour and 12-hour) were not different (p > 0.05) from the control.

Flight routes and schedules are known in normal circumstances, and passengers buy seats on these flights; however, the reverse steps happen in repatriation. Passengers express their need to travel, and flights are scheduled to satisfy their requests. The problem behind this flight schedule can be called the repatriation scheduling problem (RSP), in which we need to repatriate citizens from different countries. The objective of the RSP is to return the most vulnerable citizens first. The capacity of available airplanes and quarantine locations limit the number of repatriated citizens. To address this problem, we have developed a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to model the RSP. Moreover, we suggest a basic variable neighbourhood search (BVNS) algorithm to solve the problem. We test the BVNS algorithm by creating and solving a set of 108 RSP instances and then comparing the BVNS solutions with the exact ones. Despite allocating only 20 s to run the BVNS algorithm compared to eight hours for a commercial exact solver's branch and bound algorithm, the BVNS algorithm could find better results than the lower bounds for 62 instances and similar values for 17 instances.", "CI": ["(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Pharmaceutical companies have attempted to use various strategies to increase the success rate of drug development, but this goal has been difficult to achieve. In this study, we developed a model that can guide effective decision-making at the planning stage of new drug development by leveraging machine learning. The Drug Development Recommendation (DDR) model, we present here, is a hybrid model for recommending and/or predicting drug groups suitable for development by individual pharmaceutical companies. It combines association rule learning, collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering approaches for enterprise-customized recommendations. In the case of content-based filtering applying a random forest classification algorithm, the accuracy and area under curve were 78% and 0.74, respectively.

High accuracy is achieved by using robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based features. The technique consists of two steps. First, a video surveillance algorithm is employed to determine whether or not a human is wearing a mask. Second, Multi-CNN forecasts the frame's suspicious conventional abnormality of people.

METHODS AND RESULTS: From 15 March 2018 to 20 December 2019, patients were randomized to haemodynamic-guided management (treatment) vs. control for 12 months, with a primary endpoint of all-cause mortality plus HF events. Pre-COVID-19, the primary endpoint rate was 0.553 vs. 0.682 events/patient-year in the treatment vs. control group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, P = 0.049]. Treatment difference was no longer evident during COVID-19 (HR 1.11, P = 0.526), with a 21% decrease in the control group (0.536 events/patient-year) and no change in the treatment group (0.597 events/patient-year). Data reflecting provider-, disease-, and patient-dependent factors that might change the primary endpoint rate during COVID-19 were examined. Subject contact frequency was similar in the treatment vs. control group before and during COVID-19. During COVID-19, the monthly rate of medication changes fell 19.2% in the treatment vs. 10.7% in the control group to levels not different between groups (P = 0.362). COVID-19 was infrequent and not different between groups. Pulmonary artery pressure area under the curve decreased -98 mmHg-days in the treatment group vs. -100 mmHg-days in the controls (P = 0.867). Patient compliance with the study protocol was maintained during COVID-19 in both groups. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19, the primary event rate decreased in the controls and remained low in the treatment group, resulting in an effacement of group differences that were present pre-COVID-19. These outcomes did not result from changes in provider- or disease-dependent factors; pulmonary artery pressure decreased despite fewer medication changes, suggesting that patient-dependent factors played an important role in these outcomes.

Aim of the study was to find out a new score for predicting thrombosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We included a cohort of 674 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, not requiring intensive care units, and followed-up during the hospitalization until discharge. Routine analyses performed at in-hospital admission included also serum albumin and D-dimer while arterial and venous thromboses were the endpoints of the study. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 110 thrombotic events were registered; patients with thrombotic events were older and had lower albumin and higher D-dimer, compared with thrombotic event-free ones. On multivariable logistic regression with step-by-step procedure age, serum albumin, and D-dimer were independently associated with thrombotic events. The linear combination of age, D-dimer, and albumin allowed to build-up the ADA (age-D-dimer-albumin) score, whose area under the curve (AUC) was 0.752 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.708-0.795). ADA score was internally validated by bootstrap sampling procedure giving an AUC of 0.752 (95% CI: 0.708-0.794).

Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS) provides data support for RNA modification detection, which can preserve the potential m(6)A signature compared to second-generation sequencing. However, due to insufficient DRS data, there is a lack of methods to find m6A RNA modifications in DRS. Our purpose is to identify m(6)A modifications in DRS precisely. METHODS: We present a methodology for identifying m(6)A modifications that incorporated mapping and extracted features from DRS data. To detect m(6)A modifications, we introduce an ensemble method called mixed-weight neural bagging (MWNB), trained with 5-base RNA synthetic DRS containing modified and unmodified m(6)A. RESULTS: Our MWNB model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 97.85% and AUC of 0.9968. Additionally, we applied the MWNB model to the COVID-19 dataset; the experiment results reveal a strong association with biomedical experiments. CONCLUSION: Our strategy enables the prediction of m(6)A modifications using DRS data and completes the identification of m(6)A modifications on the SARS-CoV-2. SIGNIFICANCE: The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has significantly influence, caused by the SARS-CoV-2. An RNA modification called m(6)A is connected with viral infections.

We investigated the relationship between demographics, social determinants of health (SDOH) and cognitive outcomes 6-months after hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed 6-month follow-up data collected from a multi-center, prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographic and SDOH variables (age, race/ethnicity, education, employment, health insurance status, median income, primary language, living arrangements, and pre-COVID disability) were compared between patients with normal versus abnormal telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessments (t-MOCA; scores<18/22). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate predictors of t-MoCA. RESULTS: Of 382 patients available for 6-month follow-up, 215 (56%) completed the t-MoCA (n = 109/215 [51%] had normal and n = 106/215 [49%] abnormal results). 14/215 (7%) patients had a prior history of dementia/cognitive impairment. Significant univariate predictors of abnormal t-MoCA included older age, </=12 years of education, unemployment pre-COVID, Black race, and a pre-COVID history of cognitive impairment (all p < 0.05). In multivariable analyses, education </=12 years (adjusted OR 5.21, 95%CI 2.25-12.09), Black race (aOR 5.54, 95%CI 2.25-13.66), and the interaction of baseline functional status and unemployment prior to hospitalization (aOR 3.98, 95%CI 1.23-12.92) were significantly associated with abnormal t-MoCA scores after adjusting for age, history of dementia, language, neurological complications, income and discharge disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer years of education, Black race and unemployment with baseline disability were associated with abnormal t-MoCA scores 6-months post-hospitalization for COVID-19. These associations may be due to undiagnosed baseline cognitive dysfunction, implicit biases of the t-MoCA, other unmeasured SDOH or biological effects of SARS-CoV-2.", "CI": ["Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

There are currently no data on the process of transitioning patients established on intravenous [IV] to SC vedolizumab as part of routine clinical care. The aim of this programme is to evaluate the clinical and biochemical outcomes of switching a cohort of IBD patients established on IV vedolizumab to SC, at 12 weeks following the transition. METHODS: In all, 178 adult patients were offered the opportunity to transition to SC vedolizumab. Patients who agreed were reviewed prior to switching and at Week 12 [W12] after their first SC dose. Evaluation outcomes included disease activity scores, the IBD-Control Patient-Reported Outcome Measures [PROMs], and faecal calprotectin [FCP]. Reasons for patients declining or accepting transitioning, pharmacokinetics, adverse drug reactions, and risk factors for a poor outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients agreed to transition, of whom 106 patients had been on IV vedolizumab for at least 4 months. There were no statistically significant differences in disease activity scores or IBD-Control PROMs between baseline and W12. A statistically significant increase in FCP was observed [31 microg/g vs. 47 microg/g; p = 0.008], although this was unlikely to be clinically relevant. The most common adverse drug reaction reported was injection site reactions [15%]. Based on this cohort of patients, an expected reduction of pound572,000 per annum is likely to be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning patients established on IV vedolizumab to SC appears to be safe and effective, with high patient satisfaction and multiple benefits for the health service.", "CI": ["(c) The Author(s) 2021.

METHODS: A multicentre, prospective cohort study in 302 UK healthcare facilities of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 between 6 February 2020 and 16 March 2021. Logistic models were used to explore associations between baseline patient ethnicity, cardiometabolic conditions and multimorbidity (0, 1, 2, >2 conditions), and in-hospital cardiovascular complications (heart failure, arrhythmia, cardiac ischaemia, cardiac arrest, coagulation complications, stroke), renal injury and death. RESULTS: Of 65 624 patients hospitalised with COVID-19, 44 598 (68.0%) reported at least one cardiometabolic condition on admission. Cardiovascular/renal complications or death occurred in 24 609 (38.0%) patients. Baseline cardiometabolic conditions were independently associated with increased odds of in-hospital complications and this risk increased in the presence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity. For example, compared with having no cardiometabolic conditions, 1, 2 or >/=3 conditions was associated with 1.46 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.54), 2.04 (95% CI 1.93 to 2.15) and 3.10 (95% CI 2.92 to 3.29) times higher odds of any cardiovascular/renal complication, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for all-cause death. Compared with the white group, the South Asian (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.29) and black (OR 1.53 to 95% CI 1.37 to 1.72) ethnic groups had higher risk of any cardiovascular/renal complication. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised patients with COVID-19, cardiovascular complications or death impacts just under half of all patients, with the highest risk in those of South Asian or Black ethnicity and in patients with cardiometabolic multimorbidity.", "CI": ["(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

but is of uncertain benefit if less severely ill. We determined whether early (within 48 h) dexamethasone was associated with mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 not on IRS. METHODS: We included patients admitted to US Veterans Affairs hospitals between 7 June 2020 and 31 May 2021 within 14 days after a positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Exclusions included recent prior corticosteroids and IRS within 48 h. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to balance exposed and unexposed groups, and Cox proportional hazards models to determine 90-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of 19 973 total patients (95% men, median age 71 years, 27% black), 15 404 (77%) were without IRS within 48 h. Of these, 3514 out of 9450 (34%) patients on no oxygen received dexamethasone and 1042 (11%) died; 4472 out of 5954 (75%) patients on low-flow nasal cannula (NC) only received dexamethasone and 857 (14%) died. In IPTW stratified models, patients on no oxygen who received dexamethasone experienced 76% increased risk for 90-day mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.47-2.12); there was no association with mortality among patients on NC only (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, early initiation of dexamethasone was common and was associated with no mortality benefit among those on no oxygen or NC only in the first 48 h; instead, we found evidence of potential harm. These real-world findings do not support the use of early dexamethasone in hospitalised COVID-19 patients without IRS.", "CI": ["The content of this work is not subject to copyright.
